0,Bought these for my dog's shock collar, The first battery lasted over six weeks and was still working when I replaced it.  Great buy for the price.
0,The plant is growing & very green. Ordered many plants from this seller. They are easy to deal with. I love the look, it's unique and not available locally. Came with several deformed and yellow leaves. After removing I was left with 3 leaves. Did great in quaranteen & will be ordering again.		UPDATE: 2nd order of two more plants. They really are meant to be grouped because they are so slow growing. Looks really great with 3 together. This is a hardy, dark green intersting looking plant.
0,very good
0,These 5 stars are directly from my dog! This was our first time buying these Sweet Potato Fries, and he loves them so darn much. They're crunchier than other brands, and that make them easier for him to chew. The tricks & spins & handshakes he'll do for just one is amazing!	I'll need to buy more than one bag next time we order them. THANKS!
0,Works pretty good and has 2 speeds which is nice.  It gets pretty hot while using it, so you have to pay attention to that and let it cool off periodically.
0,Both of my dogs seem to thrive well on this product.  One of my standard-size Yorkies seems to be allergic to a lot of things.  When I switched to this dry food, his allergies seem to have lessened.  He also seems to like it for cleaning his teeth after eating canned food.
0,I've been keeping aquariums for 45 years. These bulbs are priced right and they make the aquarium look great. They are really nice and bright. They also bring out the color in the fish like no other bulb I've ever tried. I really wanted to give them 5 stars, but the fish don't like them.		My aquarium lights have always been timed to come on about the time I get home from work and go off about bed time. This way I get to enjoy the lit aquarium in all it's glory without excessive algae growth. The problem is, since I installed these bulbs, the fish hide during these hours. With all other bulbs they just kept right on foraging, swimming around, begging for food etc. Now they will barely come out even to eat if the lights are on. There are at least 7 species in the tank - a combination of different danios, tetras, sharks, barbs and cory catfish - and they all disappear when the lights come on. They will absolutely gang up in piles under every plant and decoration and wedge themselves into every crack and crevice to escape the light from these bulbs. It is very frustrating.		I thought my fish would get used to the new situation in a few days, but it has now been 2 weeks and I am still barely able to enjoy them. If something doesn't change soon I'm going to have to scrap these bulbs.		UPDATE - It has now been a month and a half and my fish STILL avoid the light from these bulbs, though the situation does appear to be improving ever so slightly. I'm going to give them another month or two and make a decision. At that time I will try and remember to make another update.		LAST UPDATE: I finally gave up and just covered 2/3 of the glass aquarium lid under these bulbs with aluminum foil. This cut down on the light so my fish would come out.		THE VERY LAST UPDATE, REALLY - I bought new stuff and redecorated the tank. This time I left it without so many places for the fish to hide. Then I removed the foil and blasted them with full light from these bulbs. After an initial period of sheer panic, (during which I really worried some of them might suffer serious injury), they calmed right down an accepted their fate. A few weeks later all is well and the tank is bright and looks great. The fish are all acting normal, eating well and their colors really shine under the lights.		Lessons learned - quality of decorations, not quantity, is the way to go if you really want to see your fish. That, and don't let the fish be the boss every time. I upped these lights from 3 to 5 stars. I am not afraid to admit I learned something new after all these years.
0,Bought for a back up I used it and was not happy with it. I had it in my 65 gal and the performance was not there so I bought a 75 gal Aqueon much better
0,It's great.
0,My kitty loves the sound it makes and gives him good exercise for hours chasing and pawing it around
0,best balls ever
0,Just as pictured.  Satisfied.
0,Perfect size for 4# Maltipoo!
0,The size, shape and design is perfect for my teacup yorkie.  Perfect height and he just eats his food so much better.  I am glad to have made this purchase!  Wonderful idea - design!
0,Fish are very fragile and quick start doesn't bother them. You will not waste your time and money with this product!
0,Fits perfectly and keeps odors at bay.  Seems to last for many months.  Easy to install and better than relying on a cheap, open litter box that doesn't require filters.
0,My dog can't get enough of them.
0,good product and fast delivery
0,Very Good
0,Used it today works great just what I needed
0,Cute and sized right
0,Our tuxedo girl loves this brush. She will come out if she sees us pick it up. It works great and I am utterly happy with it.
0,So I have 2 Chinese cresteds, they are prone to skin issues and feeding this food I have no problems!  Also my younger one came to me on kibble and he was pooping every couple hours, once I transitioned him onto HK his stools firmed up and bowel movements are much less frequent!  They have eaten the grain free turkey and the beef and love them both!
0,Gets my pup clean, smelling good and it really works great to loosen up dead undercoat and I always get a great furmination after using this waterless shampoo.
0,Our turtles love it! I had no idea it would be so much food! I was surprised when it arrived-great buy!
0,Nice brush, I have two Goldens and it is very effective for removing both loose fur and assorted burrs.
0,Fit my English Bulldog right out of the package without having to adjust! Lucky me! She's a big girl but I'm happy with the harness. I was looking for a pink one for her but the one I was looking at did not come in her size... even the biggest one they offered.
0,My cats like this product.  I got it because of a review on this site.  It said it had helped with their cats throwing up, and they were right.  Since I have been using it they don't throw up nearly as much.
0,The elastic has not held up as well as I had hoped, but collars are beautiful and the dogs love wearing them
0,This is the only tag holder I will use. I have tried several and none of them have lasted. They either would break or bend open, I would find them in my yard when I would not see them on their collars.	These are small but very sturdy, I haven't had one break yet and we have 6 active dogs. So easy to change collars with ease. Also great for car keys and anything you need to be removable.
0,Cute collar for our littlest pup. Easy to adjust and after several weeks of wear hasn't ended up with the dirt and smell that other nylon collars have after just a couple weeks of wear. Because he's a stealthy little ninja, he has to wear his collar 24/7 so we can hear the bell we attached to know when he decides to go get into something he shouldn't.
0,This is an excellent product and the dogs love it. Terrific nutritional supplement and I highly recommend it for all breeds and sizes.
0,This has been a great harness for my shiba. Its soft but effective. I love it!
0,My cat loves it! Who doesn't?
0,Good ingredients. Wish my dog liked them a little better but he will eat them usually. Like the no flour aspect.
0,Like these some puppies have a hard time chewing them but they love them.
0,This is totally worth this purchase!!! It's also under $5!!!! The bones are scent flavored which helps the dog to want to chew on it. Also great for puppies that are teething!!!! This way they do not chew on items or belongings they ought not to. So inexpensive, so it's easy to replace. Great to  help keep a dog "busy". Gives them something to do. Like a kid playing video games.
0,just as described, and quick shipping too!
0,My babies love them, thank you!
0,Smaller than I expected, but very good. Nice squeak, seems pretty durable. My dog loves playing with it in the backyard, it's easy to throw too.
0,My picky old guy that is 17 yrs old actually runs to his bowl to eat this food!  (That is a happy thing for me to see.)  I like the box with 24 because it is a good deal and I don't have to worry about running out as often.  I like the size of the cans too.
0,This light is nice, I like that the button is touch-responsive and the multiple light settings are really cool. My major complaint is that the way it clips is really limited in how thick a surface it can fit. I have a tank that has really think edges, so the light isn't able to actually clip onto the edge of the tank.
0,Human servant to the two guinea pigs reviewing the 10lb boxes of Orchard grass and Timothy Hay.		Packaging: One huge 4 foot box fit the two boxes of hay with some brown paper as stuffing.  The two smaller boxes came from JoJo's small animal store, who in turn bought and packaged Standlee's hay.  The boxes had they hay contained inside a garbage bag making it easy to lift out and dump into containers.		Hay: Previously bought Kaylee Timothy hay, the real yellow stemy stuff for ~$18 for a 96 oz bag. This Orchard grass was amazing. Lushly green with such a sweet almost tea-like smell.  The fragrance was exactly like a high quality tea from those San Francisco tea shops. Drawing that comparison emphasizes how fresh and high quality this product is.  The grass has bright green leaves and does not have stems.  One of the piggies loves nomnoming this grass, in preference over Timothy.		The Timothy hay was just as fresh smelling, though the fragrance was not as sweet.  There is a lot less stems compared to Kaylee hay.		The value in buying in bulk and such higher quality hay is seen when piggies actually eat and finish the hay in their rack.  With Kaylee the piggies tend to pick at the soft green parts and leave the tough stems.		Storage: This large amount of hay poses a storage problem in a small apartment. The hay can fit nicely in a cheap large size laundry basket ($2.95 ea) with a blanket or cloth acting as a bag.		Summary: Will continue buying this hay for the piggies. weeek weeek!
0,These work great on my English Bulldog .  I haven't found another product that can compare
0,My cat will do any think for cat nip greenies!!  These are truly the best
0,I have 3 new indoor kittens who are 4 months old and so needed a programmable feeder.  I have another one for the older outdoor cats (and visitors)  I previously bought one for my niece for her cat.  These feeders are lightweight and hold plenty of cat food.  Programming them is easier than another types.  I test them out to check the amount that dispenses out.  Also, I put duct tape strips on the lid to sides in order to prevent opening by cats or possums.  This newer model feels more lightweight than the older model, but works well.
0,Works okay. Way bigger than I thought it would be so its a little bit of a tight squeeze in my Leo's cage.
0,So far so good.  Will update if I have a problem .  Gives good lighting for the children's  red slider turtle.
0,My dog goes nuts for these treats! One of the problems that I have with my dog and treats is that he eats them too quickly, leading to weight gain,. These bones are designed as dental chews, with one side being chicken jerky, the other side a long lasting chew. It's great to give him a treat that he loves that will actually keep him happy for a few minutes. This is perfect for small to medium dogs. I've given these to a couple of friends who have finicky pups, and their dogs love them as well!
0,Cant go wrong with Blue Wilderness. This is the only dog food and any type of treat we give our American Terrier. She loves them all and not had a problem messing with her stomach.
0,Arrived alive and healthy
0,The frame is very solid. The doors blow open fairly easily in strong winds. The door faces east so I mounted a 12 inch board on the north side to deflect the wind. It works great now.
0,too soon to tell.
0,Dogs love it and it seems to help their skin.
0,Good toy for my 21lb dog and 7lb puppy. They don't play with it the way burrow toys are designed to. They like to squeak the little toys and put their nozzles in the holes, but they love it all the same so I have plenty of Egg Babies and Hide and Seek toys for them.		Slipper Bunny is about the size of a size 5 shoe, but you can't put your foot in it because the opening is too small. Build is a little flimsy, so I wouldn't recommend it for strong chewers.		Package comes with one big slipper bunny and 6 small bunnies. Slipper can only fit 3 bunnies at a time, but they give you extra 3 replacement bunnies.		Overall a great toy for my small dogs, and they seem to really like it, so I'll eventually collect them all.
0,GREAT DURABLE ITEM MY DOGS RAN OFF WITH IT AND I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT FOR MY CHILD WHO IS HANDICAPPED. IT CRINKLES NICELY AND WASHES WELL. I HAD TO GO BACK AND BUY OTHERS FOR THE ACTUAL PETS. WHO LOVED IT TOO.
0,Works great I put it in a spray bottle with water and would definitely not use with out mixing it with water last a long time I use it 3 times a week on my dog and he looks grate.
0,kind of small for a medium dog but it works for my dog and the double doors make it easy to clean.
0,Super cute, but smaller than I expected. Purchased for my boxer puppy, and intend to purchase a second since she loves cuddling with it so much! I would not recommend for larger dogs as it would be destroyed too easily.
0,Value for money
0,This works great, my dog loves it.  She has not chewed it up or destroyed it.  She loves to work out getting the biscuits out of it.
0,The highest quality of the Omega's for my dogs.would not go with anything else!
0,Nice little treats.  Afterall, it's not the size of the reward, it's the reward.  This way, she gets a few more and less calories.
0,Treat your gerbil and Hammies. I place these in her transport habbitats as well as her main one to promote exploration, she likes them
0,I would have given this a full 5 stars easily if the instructions were usable.  The leash in the instructions is green cord with green beads that slide up and down so it isn't the easiest to see.  Use the images up top in lieu of the written instructions.  The text is also small, black, and much of it is on a black background.  Instructions just suck.		Harness:	Pro's:	 - Harness will fit pretty much ANY sized lizard.  if you have a very large lizard, get the bigger harness.	 - Harness is fairly easy to put on the dragon.	 - Harness is easy to adjust.	 - Good selection of colors	 - You can put this on your lizard and let them pretty much run free in the house.  If they run up under a couch or something, you can still see the leash sticking out so it makes it easy to find the lizard even if you are not walking them (can you really walk a lizard very well anyway?)		Cons:	 - The instructions as stated above.	 - Our family has a bearde dragon named "Monster" and the cord catches on her skin as you try to put the harness on and adjust it.  The bigger the lizard, the easier this will be to overcome.  If the cord was smoother it may help, but hard to beat for the price.		I would buy this again and would recommend.
0,I love this. I bought a few cat things last week because my 5 month old kitten was driving me crazy running in circles around the house. She had lost her little rattle balls so running in circles was her new favorite hobby. This set is fantastic! My cat loves it all! They are tough too because my cat will grab them in her mouth on her back and then kick it with her back feet using her nails. Even after doing that they still look new. So no complaints. Very happy.
0,Great to find the big ones for the big dogs.
0,I love this litter box concealer. The upper cubby is the ideal place to tuck the scooper (inside a plastic bag, since it gets dirty) and other kitty gear. I use the top for their filtered water and food. It's easy to open for litterbox scooping, cleaning, and replacement. One potential problem to bear in mind: if your cat pees "high," as my newer kitty does, the pee goes over the sides of the inserted litter box (purchased separately) and runs down the side of the pet house, and into the joints between the boards. Because it's particle-board, this causes the wood to disintegrate at the joints, and the odors and moisture to accumulate in the wood. So the whole unit eventually has to be tossed. I ordered this unit as a replacement to the exact model, which my high-peeing kitty ruined. Most cats don't pee high, and before the high-peeing kitty came into the picture, this litter box was flawless, as-is. With the new one, I plan to line the sides and back with plexiglass, tarp cloth, or some sturdy plasticized material before I assemble it, to make it waterproof, and then seal the corner joints with caulk. That's pricy, and a lot of work. Maybe there's an easier option, such as finding a high-sided plastic bin and cutting it into a custom high-sided/high-backed litter box. Either way, it won't be ready for prime-time without some added work. But this product is SO freakin' awesome, otherwise, and the high-peeing kitty so rare, that I'm giving it 5-stars.
0,My dog had a severe skin rash, this has cured the problem. Maybe one more shampoo and he'll be completely clear. No more scratching.
0,nice
0,Choose the size of the crate wisely after determining the maximum size your pup may become. This crate is all you need from pup to adult.  The divider can be moved along the bars of the crate so you can adjust the size as your puppy grows. The only reason I gave this crate 4 stars instead of 5 is because while the set up wasn't hard, it wasn't simple either and the instructions that came with the crate were not helpful.
0,tuft!
0,I have been feeding these to  my dogs - they love them (my old dog actually jumps to catch them!).  I've seen no problems with diarrhea.  Ingredients look good!
0,Thank you kindly!
0,really nice kit.  I used it on a regular basis when I had my dragon fish.  it is worth the investment.
0,This bowls are a little thinner than the ones I had, but when I think about it, my dog doesn't do anything to them that would warrant thicker steel.	I used them with some 10" flower pots to make bowl stands for my 100 lb mutt. They work well and fit perfectly into place.		Would recommend.
0,Looks great in the tank
0,Ordered this for $10 and just got it today. My cat seems to really like it. He saw the box when it arrived and i opened it and told him to look and the forst thing he did was start using it and he is laying on it right now. So im satisfied if he is :3
0,Little difficult to put together , directions not accurate for steps. The pet likes very much.
0,Let's face it, if you are a dog, what's not to like about treats that contain Chicken, Sweet Potatoes, & Brown Sugar?!  My dogs all enjoy this flavor - even my little finicky Chinese Crested Powder-puff.  My only complaint is that the 3 ounce bag does last very long so get yourself two for sure.
0,Love Carbona
0,Good price & good size for frequent treats for our 45 pound pup. For our departed 65 pounder, we used to use the large ones and break them up. This is much more practical.
0,fast delivery quality product
0,Cats have enjoyed it, but it does come apart a bit too easily.
0,Very well built and nice looking! Easy to refill.
0,I love this item, and so does my dog, its works great. I'm able to keep his nails at a good length, the price was great as well, I would recommend purchasing this item!
0,Super cute ears. Shipped fast, and it seems of good quality, although I just got it today. I'm taking off the bells for sure, but the clips seems to be counter-intuitive. It's facing down when you put it on. And no, I don't think I'm putting it on wrong. It is glued on, but that's an easy fix. Simple sewing would make sure that this doesn't fall off its clip.
0,My dog likes it.
0,The Long Dog is a favorite among my dogs. The last one they had held up for nearly a year, so I had to order a new one. Great for dogs who like to chew and squeak at the same time.
0,These wonderful grooming shears arrived very quickly after I ordered them.  They are the perfect size for grooming both Max's face and delicate areas.  I feel confident using them even if he's moving around because the ends are blunt which will keep me from accidentally hurting him.  I only wish I had ordered this wonderful tool sooner, however, it's better to have them now than to never have had them at all!  If you're on the fence about these shears go ahead and jump.  This fab tool is guaranteed to take your grooming ability, on your best friend, up to the next level.
0,Finally a male dog band that fits a larger sized dog!	I have purchased numerous male dog bands and the problem with them is that although they increase the waist size, they don't account for a larger dog having "more junk in the trunk"!  The bigger they are, the more coverage they need along with additional waist.	These dog wraps&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wegreeco-Washable-Male-Dog-Belly-Wrap-Pack-of-3-Xl-25-34-34-34-waist/dp/B0183H0Z3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wegreeco Washable Male Dog Belly Wrap - Pack of 3 - (Xl 25" - 34"waist)</a>&nbsp;fit the bill for my male Weimaraner.	I purchased the XL size.  The portion that wraps around his underside (the business side) is easily 11 1/2 inches wide.  Now that covers everything!	It's nice too that the entire wrap is that wide and a has three velcro closures to ensure a good fit.  No peek-a-boo going on.	After much expense buying other brands I highly recommend these.	They come with one additional pad you can place in the wrap but the wrap itself is quite substantial with an extreme amount of absorbent padding already built in.  I would venture to guess at least 1/4 to 1/2 inch.	I'm glad someone realized that larger dogs need more coverage.
0,The dogs love it more than I do
0,Wonderful stuff.  Easily lathered and rinsed.  Very soft and silky fur afterwards.  Definitely recommend.
0,Helps his paws before and after a long hike ..
0,My cats love them - they will paw at the bag for an hour. I can't vouch for the claim that they are good for teeth, but they're a great treat at least.
0,I see many people can make their own, but this is a sturdy pole and the tug is on just right. My dog loves it and gets her energy out. I do have some shoulder pain, secondary to rotator cuff, but if you don't swing in circular motion and just do figure 8 in front of you, that still works too.		The only thing is it is a bit more expensive than making your own, but if you are busy, have no time to make it, this is an excellent product, highly recommended.
0,This is a powdered formulation that gets sprinkled on top of your pet's food.	With three dogs that eat each other's food, making sure each one gets a dose is near impossible.	Almost all dogs go crazy for coconut oil, so I mix it with that and let them lick it from a spoon, one at a time.	Works out beautifully, and they love the one-on-one attention.
0,dogs love it.
0,I bought this to replace an old ceramic crock and it fits nicely into the California cage. The only issue is that it's so lightweight that my macaw pulls it out of the holder and tosses it on the floor. I don't know if others have an unruly bird who throws things but I had to mention it to others :)
0,Nice wheelie for my dog food, airtight seal, see if it keeps the stray ants on hat try to g t in the pantry in the Texas summer.
0,After going through so many different habitats for my gerbils and being disappointed from either having broken pieces or issues or the quality not being up to par, I decided to buy this item and a number of the OVO products. I am still waiting for the main habitat to arrive before I transfer my gerbils, but the quality is impeccable and I am thoroughly satisfied.
0,The cats love this brush. It does not hurt them, even when I brush in a delicate area. Great product.
0,For those other people who complained about having to use only the cartridges that comes with the system and how pricey it can be they don't have to worry anymore because for this unit you can insert your own shampoo into it and it's better than the original bloodbath system. Unlike the one that uses 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner in a cartridge together you would have to apply conditioner separately or buy hands unless you buy the 2 in 1 shampoo bottles
0,This cat litter is absolutely the best! (I've used it for years and used to buy it in the stores until I got Amazon Prime and now I get it here with free delivery.) I have always had indoor cats and currently have three three, healthy adult cats. I have tried every litter on the market in the last 20 years  and have never found a really good one until someone suggested Precious Cat. This clumps well, is easy to clean, and there is never any odor. Seriously. I don't know how they do it, but they've created the perfect litter!		I'll add another tip - regarding a litter box. Again, many cats, many years, many different boxes. Frustrated with my current brood who takes joy in kicking litter everywhere and delights in doing stuff over the edge of the box, I started looking online for suggestions and found an inexpensive solution. Get a Rubbermaid (I like them because they are solid) container plenty big enough for your cat to sit in. We got two that are approximately 21" length X 17" wide X 13" high, ditched the lids and cut an entry about 8" off the floor and wide enough for the cats to get in and out easily. Fill it with about 3"-4" of litter. This is big enough to curtail everything. (Hope I explained that well enough.) The combo off the boxes and this litter works well.
0,This pet crate is the perfect size for my 9 lb shih tzu!!  She pretty much loves this thing and has made her home forever.  It folds down and back up easily--and is easy to take apart if you need to wash it.  An excellent investment!!!
0,I prefer the Gentle Leader over prong collars etc. It prevents pulling and is much more humane.	It may take a little for some dogs to get used to. At first our pup didn't like it, and tried to get it off a lot on walks. After a couple weeks he doesn't pay any mind to it.	Our dog is a PULLER, and this basically put a stop to that, for the most part.	50-55 lb Lab/Boxer/Pit mix, 11 months old, Medium fit him perfectly.
0,I love it and so do the birds.  It is perfect in the warmer months.
0,Great product and service.
0,The cats seem to get a few minutes of amusement out of this toy every time I bother to fish it out from under the sofa or bed they've knocked it under.
0,Love this!  I worry much less that pets have water when I am away from house.
0,I love this collar.  The colors are great and it is the best collar I have found for working with flat dog tags.
0,Great product!!  These door guards will protect my door panels from my rambunctious little pugs while riding in the back seat on their nice hammock cover I got, as well.	The door guards come with two variations of attaching them to the doors....little tabs to put down between the window and seal or velcro.  I opted to use the velcro due to the tabs not allowing to roll the windows down at all while installed.
0,Fits my 8 pound toy poodle perfectly without feeling constricted.
0,This sturdy ball works well, dropping kibble/ treats unpredictably, making them work at figuring it out, but is not too difficult. I thought it was a little bit spendy, but now I say it is well worth it.
0,If I give the cat 5-6 treats a day we have cut the hair balls down to almost nothing.
0,I know that many products use the same or similar ingredients, but Seachem is probably the top brand for general aquarium supplies, and I trust this product the most.  It does not get cloudy in the water like some other dechlorinators.
0,I rescued a 24 lb cat that cannot fit in a regular carrier and I cannot lift her in a dog crate. She fits with room to wiggle in this and I can comfortably lift in and out of the car. I can also get at least 2 of my regular sized cats(9lbs)  in it without them being on top of each other. Thinking of getting a second one in case of emergency (like evacuating for hurricanes). Love that it straps in to the car and I can put sanitizing wipes in the side pocket (vets office seats gross me out). My neighbor borrowed it for her cat who flips out about being put in a regular carrier - she said it was a breeze to get her psychotic cat in and out of so she is purchasing one too.
0,Exactly as decription describes! My pup loved this toy. Granted it's almost as long as her, but she still carries it around :)
0,Awesome & makes crinkly noise
0,Dogs like it, but not the best!
0,Love the ball
0,The material was a l little thin...but they are pretty much exactly what I expected for the price...
0,Our little 7 lb Morkie loves balls that bounce and float: this ball fills both requirements for him.  Due to their texture, the bounce will not only be vigorous but the direction of the bounce will also be a little uncertain, which keeps him very interested! Since he loves to swim, a ball that can float is a must. It's not as light as a tiny tennis ball, but tennis balls will eventually sink. This ball has deep, flexible texture, so he can grab a hold of it easily with his small mouth and then swim back to a pool step with it for more action. He will even dive in after it, he loves it that much.... so of course I had to buy more!	Neither of my 3 small, 6-12 lb dogs has been able to destroy these, so it's been a great ball for literally hours of fun, and I heartily recommend them!  The only "issue" is that you aren't able to select individual texture or color, but that hasn't bothered my little ball enthusiast one iota. ;)
0,This thing has been a lifesaver. The breeder taught him to use it before he came to our home, and it is with him in his playpen at night. Our puppy lets us sleep all night. If he has to relieve himself he goes on his little UGODOG tray and goes right back to sleep in his bed .  We just clean it out about once a week and dry it out and its ready to go again. Lately we haven't even been finding any P in there, because he is learning to hold it all night.
0,works well with dogs that like to pull.
0,hay is good pigs love it
0,As expected.
0,I always use to use Frontline but noticed that my dogs were always scratching after, not sure if they were allergic, but since I've been using K9 Advantix II they don't scratch.
0,Cheaper online than at pet stores! Works really well if you are a beginner hobbyist! Would buy again!
0,Great filters, I use them for the Aqueon Minibow
0,Like the door, some people say it is too loud--no at all--I have heard louder.  Cat must push on door, the hears the sounds and knows(once learned) that ok to enter.  Then noise again with tail clears door.  Must say difficult to program though.  Surly there must be an easier way.  Tags are large enough to print cat info and very light.	UPDATE:  Had the door in use for 2 cats during the day.  Door broke down.  Would lock hours later.  I had registered the product and contacted the company, sent them the old door, they sent me back a new door--not just a repaired door, but new door.  The warranty from this company is wonderful and easy.  Easy to work with the company and also to call.
0,My dogs like the taste of them. They eat them as though they were treats. Both my dogs are senior dogs and I have noticed a slight bit more pep in their steps.
0,it works wel
0,I was looking for a different S & C product and couldn't find it so ordered this.  The dogs love the patties so I'm quite happy with the product.  Still, I wish I could find the other product that my dogs were absolutely crazy for - it'd be nice to see a photo of the product itself rather than just the bag.		The patties get mushy if any water is introduced (humidity) so keep that bag closed tight.
0,My cats love these treats.  They are a little expensive but this is a very high quality product and I think it's worth the extra cost.  I refuse to fee my cats any food or treat that is not made in the US or Canada..  It's hard to find in my local pet supply stores,  so I am glad that it is available on Amazon.
0,My senior husky loves her bed! She used to nest, spending a considerable amount of time trying to "fluff" her previous beds. Now, she just plops down and falls into a deep snore. It's large enough for her (being a smaller husky) to share with our small terrier.		The cover is also super durable, thus far. Our dogs eat their dinners on their beds, and it can get pretty messy. The cover is easy to take off, machine washable, and is so far stain resistant. I appreciate how easy it is to put back on, as well.
0,I buy thid for my 3 dogs and there coats are shiny, and I like that fact the food is natural and has no fillers.
0,I really like the style of this jacket. It's quite easy to put on my 11 lb Shih Tzu with the Velcro. She doesn't really like the hood but it comes off easily and she's getting use to it.  It's really helps to keep her warm on walks and her romps in the back yard with all the snow.  The only reason I didn't give the jacket a 5 is the description said there was a place to access her collar. I see a slot, but it is sewn shut. I'm afraid to tear open in case I ruin the jacket. Regardless, this jacket is well worth the price.
0,great
0,This is a pretty nice quality bed, especially for the price. I really like that you can remove and wash the cover of the cushion. My cat took to it right away which I was happy about since she's never had a cat bed. I wanted something to help her stay warm this winter since she's an older cat.
0,Great
0,Cats and Dog absolutely love it!!!  bought it because one cat wanted running water but all three think it is the only way to drink water now - they would not want to be without it.
0,Great!
0,nice bins but could latch a little better/more secure.
0,My cats really play with these toys. Fun at a good price.
0,I love it! I bought the 50' leash to give my young rescue some freedom and to help her learn the limits of the property. Been using it as a drag line also. It was a great purchase. I will be buying other sizes.
0,My 2 cats consistently like it.
0,Dogs Loved it!!
0,Only product that's ever worked for skunk smell removal!! 100% recommend!! Use asap once your animal has been sprayed thought... timing is everything.
0,My dog enjoys this!  It took him a while to figure it out, but we put his dry food in it and he is entertained for a while.  Dust and such will stick to the surface of this ball, unfortunately, but it does seem sturdy, if you dog is a big chewer!
0,Just wish you could buy refills
0,Works fine
0,I have large dogs that want to help me drive the car.  This tether clips to the seat belt and their collar.  It gives them enough room to sit up (it's adjustable) or lay down but not climb into the driver's seat.  If they're in the back, I know they aren't roaming around.  They are too large for travel crates and this gives me the satisfaction that they're belted into place when we're driving.  Love how easy it is to clip on and off.
0,Sweet poo bags, Yo.
0,Great quality product from a great brand.  Online price here is usually great.
0,This toy is one of our dogs favorite when loaded.  We can get pieces of chicken jerky treats inserted into these holes and it frequently takes our dog awhile to get them out.
0,Bought two. Completely resisted any nibbling from my Belgian Malinois and German Shepherds as we drove across the country. Very durable cables, strong, easy to use (note: never attach restraints to your dog's collar, always use a harness designed for car restraint; never allow your dog to sit in the front seat). The 21" length was the perfect length to attach their K9 harnesses to the rings in the back of my Ford Escape. For some reason after 3 months and the clip that attaches to the car broke on one. The little thin metal piece (tongue?) popped out of the clip. About a month or 2 later, the same metal clip on the second one popped out too. Not sure if I got a funky batch, because nobody else has had this issue, or if the flat shape of the rings in my SUV caused the problem (the rings on the dog harness have a rounded edge, the rings on the car have a flat/squared edge - maybe caused the tongue to get stuck and pop out?), but the customer service was amazing!	I emailed them and right away they sent me 2 replacements - we went with the longer length of 26" to see if that makes any difference. Overall the clips are great, though. I absolutely recommend these over other chewable options.
0,Finally, a comb that gets all knots out of my Persian kitty's matted hair. She gets them easily but with this comb I can keep her tangle free! I love this comb for long hair cats. And I've bought several in the past that were substandard even though more expensive!
0,Our bull dog mix loves this thing and so far it's the one thing she has not torn up!!!
0,worked as indicated, bulk purchase to keep what i need on hand
0,I have been sprinkling this on both of my dogs food since I got it.		It seems to help with their coats (8 yr old Husky/1 Yr Old German Shepherd). The husky has pretty bad hip problems and this, with his other supplements has been helping him quite a bit and we have noticed that he has been moving around better than normal.		We will continue to use the Missing Link powders as we seem to make quite a bit of difference in our dogs lives.
0,He's definitely whiter! I also think it gets him cleaner than other shampoos. Works great on his paws!
0,This is one of our dog's favorite toys. She will drop everything else she's doing when this toy comes out. Its extremely well stitched, she's been chewing on it for weeks now and has barely raised any threads at all. Ideal size/weight for a large breed puppy to tote around, and she's in love with the squirrel look. Would really like to get some more of these in the other designs.
0,Our dog no longer has bad breath but you have to be careful because this stuff is fattening.
0,My cat loves this and am always seeing her on it like its a new bed for her
0,Awesome product. Would recommend this in a heartbeat. Also comes with a dog seat belt!
0,both my cats love it
0,Excellent.
0,My dog loves it.  Gotta buy more every so often.
0,Did not work for either of my dogs.
0,This is my cats' favorite toy. I also foster kittens and this one is always a favorite. Such a simple toy that gives lots of enjoyment!
0,Awesome light. Makes my tank look great day and night.
0,Too big for my dog, should have gotten a small.. unfortunately my dog has zero interest in it, but my friend's dog goes NUTS for this thing.
0,Yes , it's true ... She loved it & Her itching process dropped 80 % , considering the current weather condition right now , this fantastic shampoo gave/offered to Her a long relief issues ... So , after bathing , "we" decided to give/leave 100 stars , instead of 5 , only ... Strongly Recommended , of course ...
0,We had a flirt pole before, but the rod wasn't very sturdy and broke off several times and finally got too short to play with, which is why we bought this one. I love that the rod is longer, keeps the dogs from jumping on your feet. The extra refill toy is a great deal, even though I haven't needed it yet. Gets so much energy out of my dog, he just loves it.
0,I purchased several of these to donate to two different rescues. The are terrific. Strong and easy to clip, best of all the handle has a little padding that makes it super comfortable with a new dog learning not to pull.
0,My cat has kidney stones and other UT issues. Therefore he pees outside his box(s). I have tried close to a dozen odor removers which have failed. Don't know how I heard about this but I tried it and IT WORKED/WORKS!!!  Follow the directions!!  My dog also got sick in the car, he had a bowel obstruction, so on the way to the hospital he vomited- the smell was fowl & sewer like--it was BAD. Anyway, I used this generously in my car-it took a couple days for the enzymes to do their job but it worked completely. I honestly had my doubts but it really did the job. I buy this at our grocery store for $5.99-I stock up and even gave to a couple friends who have had ill cats. Again, FOLLOW the directions. You don't want to kill the enzymes which kill the odors.
0,FANTASTIC. We've used all sorts of brushes over the past 15 years for a Lab who sheds constantly. The brush is great with the shedding as well as retracts to remove clumps of hair rather than to have it fly all over the yard. First saw it used by a professional dog washer and so glad we have our own now!
0,I was in desperate need of something to stop my kitty Butterball from destroying my husband's leather chair. I feel that declawing is painful to the kitty, so I am trying to avoid that at all costs.  These have stayed on him very well, I read the reviews about clipping his nails. He also doesn't seem to mind them, I have not seen him chewing them or trying to pull them off. However, I did manage to glue myself to his stomach. It made my husband laugh, even though I did spend the rest of the night trying to remove super-glue and long orange cat fur from my hands :D  I also noticed where the glue touched his fur it got pretty warm. Just be careful not to get the glue on your hands before touching kitty!! :D
0,works great . we are happy and so is our big boy kitty cat.
0,I really like this mat. My cat didn't like it at first because it feels different from the other mats I've used. It only took her a few minutes before she was okay using it. I love that it's so small and can fit in any space without taking up a lot of room.
0,Nothing better than a squeaky tennis ball! Squeaker doesn't hold out as well as you'd hope but it does get heavily squeaked so I kind of don't blame it. I like the fact that it is as thick as a regular tennis ball. I notice some of the other ones at the store are thinner which isn't worth the purchase for me because it would be torn apart in minutes. But really, if you have a squeaker obsessed dog like I do, the idea of a tennis ball that squeaks seems to blow their little minds.
0,For car trips, I usually put both of my cats into a larger hard-sided carrier so they can hang out. I purchased the SturdiBag for occasions where only one cat is on the move. It's a great bag. It assembles very easily and the quality is excellent. I love the locks on the zippers and all of the options for ventilation. The strap is long enough that I can sling it or wear it on one shoulder. The pad inside is very soft and easy to clean. My cats like it so much they sleep in it between trips, which adds to the value since they only travel a few times a year. I especially like how the panels on the top open up so my cat can see me at all times. One thing of note, however, is that this is still a pretty large carrier. I walk to the vet and where I run into problems is that my cat curls up into a little ball in the corner, throwing the centre of gravity WAY off and making the bag feel very unwieldy. This isn't any fault of the bag, just something to take into account if you have a pet who likes to curl up and you plan on using this bag on walks. I also purchased a SturdiTote, which looks more like an insulated picnic basket than a pet carrier. It is VERY tiny (your cat will not be able to sit up in it) but my vet said it's just fine for short trips because I have "if I fits, I sits" kitties who feel safer when they're confined. You'll be able to find a Sturdi product that works for you. It's a really great company.
0,Secures dogs and restricts excessive movement.
0,Had two packs on top shelf of study bookcase. While I was out, cats found them, ripped them open - mouse toys all over the place. Yeah, they love these things.
0,My troublemaker cat (who, me-ow?) needs to have a little bit more human oversight to keep out of trouble so the extra bells on his collar help. Thanks!
0,My dog went crazy for this cake! He and his friends loved it. I have to be honest... it smelled amazing too. I kinda wanted a piece. It was more of a cookie than a cake, but who cares! It was a huge hit!
0,I don't own a cat...works perfect in my steam cleaner for my puppy can't beat the price
0,My dogs love this food.  Salmon is the first ingredient and you can really smell the salmon in the food, and your dog's breath.  I like salmon so it's no big deal, and because of the salmon, my dogs love it.  I did a lot of research on dog food, and this is the brand I chose to feed all three of my dogs.  I have a 60 pound pit and two 10 pound chihuahua mixes.  They all eat this well.  I see sometimes food for small breeds, where I assume the nuggets are really small, but my little dogs have no problem eating it.  Our cat even will eat it too.  I guess the salmon is too much of a temptation!  I bought some cat food with salmon and now he's eating his own food.
0,Amazon has no Aquastyle 9-gallon tank in stock.  So I paid $149 and got one locally.  Glad to support our ma-n-pa fish shop too.  All 3 sizes of Aquastyle systems use the same pump and lighting system.  So if I find its internal filter a lil' big for 9g, imagine its impact on the smaller counterparts.  The aquarium is very nice with seamless front curved corners.  Glass thickness is 5mm which makes it compatible with a lot of universal accessories, but the glass lid will probably have to go in such circumstance.  Will set it up soon and edit my review.
0,quality collar.  works well.  i like the settings and controls.  the 'nip' function i found to be the most impactful, as i have the collar dialed down to the lowest possible setting to still get my corso's attention.  that's all i need.  he doesn't require pain, just something to garnish his quick attention which is the way i train.  all in all i'd give it a five stars, but i wished the battery threshold was a tad higher.  i prefer to use collars for quite a while through the day when training puppies, so they can have a collar on several hours.  this collar simply won't last an entire 18hr day, so i buy multiple collars and rotate them out.		granted, for my purposes they are bit light on stamina, but for conventional training, obedience, tracking, etc. with collars on the animal for shorter periods of time you'll do well and experience no issues.		we use this collar rain, shine, snow, in water, in rocks, in mud, etc.  it is tough.  yes, it eventually looks a bit beat up - anything will.  but it always works and there have been no problems with its operation.  not once.		to give you an idea of the power settings, i can take the dogra collar and place it in my hand or along my arm and i have to dial it up to about 23 or so (the scale goes from 0 to 100) before i feel a tingling sensation.  when i hold the button down applying the buzz on my corso, he notices it at roughly 16 or 18.  so he isn't getting 'shocked' but rather just enough sensation to get his attention.  while he and most other working breeds hold a high threshold for pain, they tend to be more sensitive than you and in also.  again, the infinite settings and the quality of the dogtra collar in general make it ideal for true training.		having used dogtra brands and others, i can say dogtra is the only true high quality brand available.  the others pale in comparison, don't work as well in terms of distance and consistency, and don't allow the fine tuning of the shock/correction.  i'm a big fan of applying ONLY enough buzz to say "hey, stay focused on me" and no more.  unfortunately the other brands you'll see out there simply don't offer fine tuning like this and have just a few settings - frankly, it defeats the purpose of ecollar training to some degree and i recommend away from them.  infinite settings vs presets have no comparison and dogtra is a brand that has this right.  others, not so much...
0,After giving these (5 daily) to my 100lb dog for about 10 days i can see a difference. His shedding has reduced tremendously, however its effect in joints might take some more time. Good for the price.	Would recommend.
0,Bought this to add Omega 3s to my two dogs diets and maybe address some dry skin issues with one of them.  Sadly the itchyness has not gone completely away, but, the dry skin has.  Their coats are now incredibly soft as a clear bonus.
0,I bought this filter refurbished (w/ ugly packaging) to use in my new 10 gallon divided betta tank. It arrived on time and in great condition for a refurbished product. It was stupidly easy to put together, and I had it in my tank a few minutes later. It's strong, meaning the current can be kind of uncomfortable for fish such as Bettas. To fix this problem, I merely stuck two sponges in front of the outtake/waterfall area and put the lid on to secure it. This slowed the water to a perfect gentle flow. Because my tank is decided, I tried putting the filter in between the two sides and it's working like a charm. The actual filter is very quiet, which is amazing, and it looks great on my tank. Hopefully it holds up. Good product for the price.
0,My dogs love these.  I have to say that they smell pretty gross like salmon but that is why my dogs like them so much.  I take a handful out and store them in a bag to carry around.  This bag is a bit too big to carry.  Other notes is that my 50lbs dog can handle these no problem.  My 14lbs dog only gets half as it would take her a while to chew it due to the smaller mouth.  Long story short is my dogs love these.
0,What can you really say about dog food?  Our dog likes it (although she is NOT picky) and seems to do well on it.  It's a medium priced brand and our breeder recommended it.
0,What can I say...My dogs love them..I am almost tempted to try one myself!! :)	If you have to give a dog a daily pill as I do Pill Pockets are wonderful
0,Very good product and works well
0,First of all, these beds came so quick!!!! These really are nice and sturdy beds. I'm really happy with these purchases and was also pleased that they were affordable!!
0,I have a Russian tortoise that openly resents the fact that she does not have unlimited access to the outdoors.	However, since we live in PA, and because I have no intention of building a mess of an outdoor pen, I wanted to	get an option that would allow her to be outside and not be constricted by glass, etc. (She still has to be enclosed	as we have a number of hawks around that would be more than happy to grab her)		Thus, I tried this product.		In short, this would make a great indoor or outdoor pen. As mentioned, we use it outside and it is great.
0,Wanting to give my kitties more variety, I ordered besides the seafood pack of 24 the chicken, turkey giblets and beef pack.	Unfortunately both cats refused to eat the beef. Why? I have no idea. But the chicken and turkey giblets were eaten with mucho gusto! It was worth the try and I exchanged the beef cans for other varieties at my pet store.
0,My cats really like it. I used velcro to attach it to the wall instead of the silly tape they provided. That stuff is not helpful. The velcro is great because you can take it off if you need to clean it out. I put catnip in it only once. They like it without also. My one male cat seems to prefer it most. Make sure you put it about the height of their cheeks. That's what they like to rub on it!
0,Great price!
0,Exactly as promised and I would buy this product and from this seller again... Thanks!
0,My 80 pound Plott Hound loved it-and he hasn't destroyed it yet like he has with other ropes.  It's his favorite!
0,This under tank heater (UTH) gets pretty hot and I do highly recommend getting a thermostat to keep proper temperatures when you are keeping reptiles that require a specific range. This product WILL get into the 90s easily. I do recommend buying this product with a digital thermometer and a thermostat to help ensure proper temperatures and so your little reptile buddy doesn't burn up.
0,Works great..
0,We have had Lucee our Golden Doodle (7 years old) on this probiotic now for a couple of months.  She gets one scoop every meal.  It has made a remarkable difference in her, skin, ears and poops!  Nothing like a nice solid poop from your dog, right!  We highly recommend this product, I will be ordering more pretty soon.  She is definitely going to stay on this.  Thanks Pet Ultimates!
0,Love this collar!!!  Easy on/off and looks great
0,These little bowls are perfect for traveling with our 2 furry babies. I put one in my car and one in the stroller we use for them. I was glad they did not have the weird smell some plastic bowls do. The dogs did not hesitate to drink from them.
0,My dwarf bunny loves these!  She eats a small quantity every day.
0,Dogs like it
0,My cat used to crawl behind the water heater and so I bought this to stop him and it has done its job well. Very easy installation. Came on time and without any damage. Love it.
0,I have used other products through the years and I like this one the best. Wish it cost less as we have 3 rescued dogs and 5 cats. Why is it that small dogs pee in the house? We have one small dog and 2 large dogs. Once the small dog dies, (he is now 11),  I will not need to buy this as much. I can say this about him as he was a rescue dog and we took on his issues. Now we know why he was probably put up for adoption..He will pee in front of an open door, and a huge dog door. No more small dogs for me. I know I am ranting, but it is hard to love a dog that ruins 2 houses. He is well trained except for that problem.		Meanwhile, this product does help.
0,When I shake this thing and make it "chuckle" my Golden comes running and gets super excited. But when she takes the toy from me and can't figure out how to make it chuckle herself, she comes running to give it back to me! Perhaps there is an easier way to make the toy chuckle that Premier could change the design to???
0,My pet loves these.
0,great keeps the tank clear
0,I love this little hoodie!  My Maltipoo puppy is about 2lbs right now and it fits her nicely.  She definitely has a little room to grow, so I think it will be fine for her for the next few months and possibly forever, depending how much she grows.  She looks adorable in it and we have already received many compliments!  The color is well-represented.  I purchased the XS and am very pleased.
0,I've gone through a few bags of these treats, and my dogs LOVE them! As in sitting by the cookie jar crying for more while drool puddles form on my clean floors. Neither of my dogs have experienced upset tummies, ear infections, coat issues, etc. from the treats, nor have i seen any increase in weight. All good signs! The ONLY DOWNFALL of these treats is they STINK to high heaven! However my pups love them so much I'm willing to overlook the odor! Bonus feature is they can easily be cut in half or quarters for training. Of course your hands will smell like fish... but a happy puppy is worth it! Also great are the plato eos turkey-pumpkin and turkey-sweet potato treats.
0,My cats love it and looks good with me decore
0,Excellent product, excellent quality.	My dog loves it & it is perfect to keep your dog busy.
0,This is one HUGE canister for a 10 gal tank, but what a deal! Definitely recommend!
0,best dog food - everything is identifiable - if you want the ease of canned / wet food, in my opinion, there's no better - additionally, this price is very good!
0,Easy to put on take off. Dog has not tried to take it off!!
0,Wonderful product and no more sticking my arm in the tank to retrieve a suction cup clip!!!
0,We've had this bed in use for about 9 months and love it! Sturdy, well made and easy to clean. Fabulous product!!!
0,Even my picky German Shepherd who usually sniffs all treats disdainfully took these without hesitation.  A keeper!
0,Cat loves it
0,cats LOVE these.. they don't even chase the ball on the track anymore, they just love the cardboard.. plus they don't scratch our stuff either anymore.. great purchase!
0,Emma likes.  She eventually can still extract the squeaker..but she's a pit bull and nothings going to stop her.
0,I bought this after going through several plants for my Betta.  This is silk so it is safe for his fins.  It moves gently in currents (I have reduced current for my Betta.)  Overall this is safe and looks great.  I am adding lives plants also but will keep this in the tank because my Betta likes it.
0,My dogs told me to rate this with 5 stars.
0,My cars really liked the flavor are chowing down on the stuff. I have used other IAMS products in the past and saw good results wth them. This one has provided good results as well.
0,I have a very hyperactive puppy and I find Pet Corrector startles her a little, like if she's in the middle of her daily barking marathon, she'll be startled and stop barking for a moment. That little break gives me the opportunity to redirect her to do something more positive. I never spray it at her, but I spray it where I'm sitting. She usually stops right away and comes running over to see me which is great for training.
0,I'm in love with my Babycakes! This is adorable! We get a million compliments every time she wears it!
0,I love it!! Followed the sizing directions and fits perfect
0,He loves them
0,Work well
0,This stuff worked great killing the fleas around our house and on the bedding and floors. I also dip a flea comb in it and comb my kitten. She hates it but it quickly kills the fleas and it smells nice. She's licked herself afterward and she was fine so I think its ok as far as her licking it off herself. All in all it worked great and we see less and less fleas as we keep using it. I'm on my second bottle.
0,work very well
0,the cats liked them so much they hid them after the first night and i never saw them again.
0,I bought two of these. They first one is great & amazin and the suction cups on mine rarely come off. The second one, however, broke because the plastic had a cut that severed the piece, but I still use it since it still works.
0,We love our finches and buy products that we trust to keep them in perfect shape.
0,Looks great on my shepherd.  Sturdy and cute.
0,My two indoor cats haven't been to the vet since they started eating this, which has been for five years at least.  I think that speaks volumes.
0,Bought extra strength velcro per other recommendations and it went up no problem. The cats love it, we have a birder feeder outside the window and they spend hours watching! It stays super warm too!
0,It's fine. The push button is hard to work and I feel it doesn't stay 100%
0,Perfect
0,Seems to be potent! does the job without the mess!
0,Good product, very sturdy, trying to get my kitten to learn to use it more often and get off the furniture. lol.
0,Very accurate in keeping temperature consistent. Only annoyance is adjustment knob indicates 83 degrees for my desired setting  of 78.  Oh well, how often is the setting changed?
0,Pretty good cat tree. The cats love laying on top. Sadly, only one can fit up there and once they are bigger, i wonder if they can fit at all up top. but for now, its lovely.
0,Needed the large one, but everything by Starmark is the best.
0,This thing is fabulous. The entire inside is lined with fleece and it's nice and soft for our little Chihuahua. She has very little fur, especially under her forelegs, and most harnesses chafe her tender skin. The color is nice, it seems well sewn, and adds a little extra warmth.
0,One of my favorite chews for dogs and I can't find a better price.
0,It works really well and has a double layer so it is sturdy. The loops it has are all in a very comfortable position so that I can wear it cover my shoulder with my service dog with so problems. The clips that attach to the dog and to the loops are good size so they will fit onto any collar or loops. I give it 4 stars because I wish it was 1 inch wide instead of 1/2 inch or 3/4 inch. The length is pretty good for walking small dogs on it as well as large dogs. It's nice to be checking out at the grocery store with my service dog laying on the floor and not have to hold the leash.
0,cats love, but puppies keep stealing
0,They are exactly what I was looking for, a mattress that will handle two symptoms that are degeneration in the bones and muscular problems. At this time I have two elderly dogs and one tube a pain attack that was treated for two weeks, from there to investigate if there were options to give more comfort and quality of life, including changing their beds because I had my suspicions that these were not They required and I really needed a change that I did not find in my country. The reaction of my dogs was immediate both were ocostaron in their beds, they did not snore and you see them resting comfortably, it was one of my best purchases and I would buy them without hesitation
0,All perfect, thanks!!!!
0,Perfect fit for the gate we ordered. Fits nicely into the space we needed to have gated off.
0,I love this and my favorite part is its adjustable air flow and it has two outlets really strong air flow love it would recommend it to anyone and I'd buy again.
0,Perfect. So nicely made and sturdy. Holds it shape well and had two different ways to get you pet in and out.
0,Whisker safe pet dishes.  Made for larger cats.  Too big for kittens.  Mine crawls in bowl to eat.  A smaller diameter version would be better.  Overall pretty satisfied.
0,These fit well and work great, I put in a new one about every two weeks and rinse them in between changing.
0,Arrived alive and doing well,  even a free floating one seems to be ok, despite not really having roots. I think there are some small baby plants growing on some leaves, or is it something to worry about? I'm not sure since its my first fern so time will tell.
0,I have these in three of my birds cages
0,This really does control odor-with multiple cats it does the trick!
0,My little terrier LOVES these, and so do I. I've been giving these to my pup for about two years now, and he looks forward to getting one everyday. I can tell they help with his teeth and breath, because his breath is never an issue. These are also a nice daily reward for reinforcing any training or tricks, which is what I use it for as well. I make him sit, stay, lay down, and roll over a couple times before he gets one. Highly recommend!
0,I really like this dog food. My dog has been itchy/scratchy through most seasons. I recently decided to try an all natural diet to see if that might help. While it did temporarily, nothing helped as much as TotW. Yes, she still itches. No, it isn't a magical product. But so far it's the only thing that has made it manageable.		The kibble is very small, maybe pea shaped; and I believe my pup likes the flavor. This is best deal for TotW I've found; only on Amazon.
0,It really gets the odor and the stain out completely.		I had a bad odor coming from the carpet, probably the urine was soaked the carpet to the bottom. I tried everything I could to get the odor out. I tried the Nature's Miracle original formula, carpet shampoo, all-purpose odor remover, etc. None of the methods I tried removed the odor completely. But this really got the odor out. I soaked the area with the formula and let it sit for like an hour and I vacuumed it out with my carpet cleaner. It completely got the stink out and I am very happy with the result. The best product to remove pet urine!
0,Although the cap came undone in the shipping box, I still managed to get all the wafers back into the container.  Smells like plant and my pleco's seem to love it.  Price listed is reasonable.  Appears to be a good product.
0,My cats love this blend from Wellness. For one of my cats who was sleeping, I put a bowl filled with Wellness Salmon and Whitefish under her nose. She immediately woke up and followed me out to the kitchen and chowed down her meal! This is the only recipe with rice that I feed my cats (their other foods are grain free). Cheaper to buy 2 5lb. bags than 1 11 lb 4 oz. bag (doesn't make much sense, does it!)..Anyway, cats are happy no matter what size bag I buy.
0,This is exactly what we were looking for when training our dogs to let us know when they wanted to go out.
0,My two Boxer pups love these and although they don't last long, I feel that they are good for their teeth.  Think they must be tasty as they both 'sit and wait' for these.		The smallest pup has a tendency to put her head way up in the air so she can swallow them before she chews them completely.  Has not choked yet but I keep a careful eye on her.		As always, supervise your pets while chewing and make sure they have an ample supply of water.		Most highly recommended.
0,This is so much better than the smaller trays and my shih Tzu pup is only 8 lbs. The bigger tray gives her room to pace when she has to poo and no accidents over the tray. Highly recommend. Costco carries the extra large 23x30 disposable pads (100 for $15).
0,I like this carrier.  Kitty doesn't, but she never does.  It's a little small for her, but she's a very large cat.  But it's easy to carry and the double zipper  at the top is easy to close with the pull strap that zips both at once.  I think it's worth the money for her vet visits.
0,UPDATE 2: So they've edited the image, so yes it is the same now. So I'll change the stars, but I still can't get it to work that well I think it's just me.		UPDATE: Amazon took off my links so I'm going to try and post it in the image thing above.	My laptop is a 14" so you can kind of tell the size of the thing.		When I got back from class today I found a HUGE grey/white bag waiting for me at the door. I opened it to find a Siphon Cleaner as it says on the tag...it's not the same one as the picture above (it's a Chinese knockoff), also it's really BIG! I guess it would be great for huge tanks...a lot bigger than mine anyway. But I got a free feeder (they sent it to me at first, then sent the correct item, they did not want the feeder back.) so I can't really complain.		Here are pictures of the item I received in the mail.
0,I bought this for my new dog I adopted this year. I tried a few different brands before this and we've settled here now. It's healthy, much more affordable than the other grain free brands, and my girl loves it. Also, I'm not sure how related this is but I do think it's helped a lot with her itchy and dry skin that bothered her terribly. Since switching she barely scratches anymore. Highly recommend!
0,Great value for 2 of these.  They don't blast corals...provide a nice soft flow.  The suction cups suck though - they will eventually let go...every one I've had of these has done it.  So, I glue magnets from old failed Koralia powerheads to the unit, so I can use a magnet on the outside to hold it.  Works perfectly.  Can't beat the price.  I've had one for a couple of years so I know they last.
0,My pup loves this! She chewed on it for an hour straight until I took it away to make it last longer. All the marrow has been chewed out but she still loves chewing on the actual antler that's left. Good buy!
0,Squirrel is cute. Bought for parents dog. Like a kong but much, much heavier. The bottom is cut table for adjusting of treat flow. Probably shouldn't be thrown.... Way too heavy.
0,My cats love these. I had to do a little extra anchoring to the window sill though. I didn't trust it to stay up there without anchoring.
0,We are not fans of topical or oral flea and tick medication because we feel you're essentially giving them poison. We use the herbal defense powders, collars, and sprays, but this vest gives us peace of mind. In two years, we haven't found a single tick on him while using it, and we live in a high tick area. We bought another vest to use for when this one wears out.
0,This is exactly what I wanted! I am using this to train my dog to stay in the yard. It's long enough so that if she starts to head off, I can catch up to her and step on the rope, and the fact that there is no loop keeps her from getting easily caught up on something as she wanders around. I find the quality and thickness of the rope to be very good. I've had it for a couple of years now and it has held up very well. I have the orange color and it does get dirty and it can get smelly, but I just swish it around in a soapy bucket now and then, rinse it, hang it in the sun to dry and all is good!
0,This is a fantastic snacky-type good for small animals! We always purchased it at a pet store near us, but by chance stumbled upon it in here and it is so much cheaper!! Hamsters absolutely LOVE IT, Guinea Pigs devour it and Rabbits happily much away on it! Such a wide range of so many yummy little treats for them!! Highly recommended!
0,Great little dress ! Size true and material is very nice.
0,I bought this leash for my 55lb pit mix puppy. I love the padded handles. Hes still in the learning process and still a puller so my hand is usually sore at the end of a walk but not with this leash. I love the shorter handle to be able to use if needed. This leash is definitely heavy duty and seems to be made well an very sturdy. I would highly recommend this leash if you're looking for a leash for a medium to extra large dog.  Also, I was emailed by the company thanking me and asking if I was happy with my purchase. So not that I had to contact them, because Im totally happy with my purchase, but Id guess they probably have pretty great customer service.
0,Great quality construction.  My puppy uses it every day and it's like new. Good plastics used.  I recommend it highly.
0,In just one week, it helped me catch up in cycling my tanks alongside Prime. My 10g and 20g baby goldfish tanks' parameters seemed improved. Im happy with this.
0,My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel loves the taste of these.  After she finishes her breakfast each morning, she runs up to me, tail wagging, waiting for her tab.  She has not had any negative reaction to them.
0,This is awesome my dogs love the feel of it.
0,best product to get rid of pet stains and odors. i spray this on carpet, bedding, pillows, and anything else that doesn't fit into the washing machine.
0,My sheltie loves squeak toys, but this is her fave. Washes well in the machine
0,Great product, it does not cloud the water, and helps keep the fish looking vibrant as well
0,LOVE these! My dog takes them so easily and asks for it every morning, I got these originally because she has hurt her shoulder and it wasn't getting better, she took the first bag with ease so I bought more! This was the only thing that helped her shoulder get better, she is acting younger every day. I am very thankful for these treats as I'm not always sad anymore that my little girl is limping and can't get on the couch.
0,We are very happy with the citronella bark collars.  We have three dogs, all are terriers and they can get into a bark-fest.  These collars have worked wonders, and are truly humane-- they work without pain. I wouldn't use one of the shock collars. They are not "humane"- they shock and they hurt! If you don't believe me, put it on your own neck and give it a try.  I have seen dogs with burns on their necks from those. (As an aside, yes, I tried this citronella collar too. I let it spray me full in the face.  Not pleasant, but not painful.) If you love your dog, try this method.  BTW, don't buy the expensive replacement batteries here. They are a standard size and can be obtained at any Walgreens, Target, etc for around $3.
0,I read every review trying to figure out what size to buy for my Golden Retriever that weighs 55-60 lbs.  I ended up buying the Medium and it fits perfect, if she was a little smaller or a little bigger, it would still adjust just fine to fit her.  I hope this helps if you're trying to figure out sizes.  She has escaped out of every other harness I've bought her, but not this one so I'm very very happy with it.
0,I have a whisper 70ex thinking these sponges would stretch to fit. Nope! So I took the wide intake off and slipped the sponge over the straight part of the intake. It worked perfectly!
0,Excellent grain free cat food!! My finicky cat loves this stuff. I am glad to see it on Amazon! However, the price is absolutely absurd!!! With shipping it is over $30 for a four pound bag? That must be a typo of some sort. I just got back from Stop & Shop and paid only $11.99 and no shipping! But like I said, a great grain free food for cats.
0,Fairly pricey but my English Mastiff loves them.  After he's done licking out half the PB fill, my friend's Bichons enjoy them for days.
0,This harness is soft as described. It is just the right size without being cumbersome.  My dog does not mind wearing it.  The loop to attach the leash is properly placed and easy to use.
0,Chuck it makes the best toys-2 year old border collie
0,My 2 Chihuahuas love it very sturdy.
0,my birds love this seed
0,Got it for my dogs 10th birthday! So adorable!
0,My dog is so much more well behaved with this collar on.  Lots of people say bad things about prong collars, but if used in a proper and educated way, they can be so helpful and make a huge difference in your pet's behaviour!  Highly recommend.
0,Both our boys love these treats.
0,Marineland has done a nice job with this multi-use filter.  I can't speak to the performance as a full-time carbon-reactor, although I agree that it's a little too visible to want to use in a display tank in this way (for example, why on earth is there a bright red stripe on equipment that should be designed to be as invisible as possible?).  For a polishing filter, it's an easy-to-use all in one, and does a good job of trapping water-clouding contaminants in it's paper membrane.		The biggest upside of this design, however, is as an in-tank diatomaceous earth filter.  If the 15 micron-level filtration provided by the paper filter isn't sufficient for your purpose, the instructions suggest "charging" the filter with&nbsp;&nbsp;(by putting the filter in a bucket of water with added diatomaceous earth powder, until the filter has captured it all), and enjoying the sub-micron filtration capability.  To my knowledge, this is the only in-tank diatomaceous earth capable filter on the market (the Vortex line of filters are all external, and fiddly).
0,This product has worked wonders for my greyhound's skin and coat. His fur feels like silk now, and his dandruff has definitely slowed down!
0,So far I have only had various black birds visit my log jammer regularly but a blue jay stops by ocassionally. The log jammer keeps the big birds out of my regular seed feeder.  The suet plugs seem to last only a few days, so the birds must like it!
0,cute, great fit, very thin fabric.
0,Works great and I know my dogs are eating it.  Disappointed that I can't get it on Amazon any longer
0,My boys love this toy. They'll be getting another once they've finished this one off
0,I was starting to see a green hair algae outbreak in my planted tank and had read good things about this product, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The tank I treated is stocked with Celebes rainbowfish and dwarf neon rainbows, and is lightly to moderately planted with mostly beginner plants - a couple amazon swords, vals, some rotala, a few crypts, anubias, and java ferns. I dosed exactly as directed (1 mL per 10 gallons every 3rd day), and saw the hair algae start to die back after the second dose. After the 3rd dose most of the algae was gone. None of my fish or plants showed any negative effects (and Celebes rainbows are sensitive to water quality issues). I'm impressed, it worked for me.		It is important to know that Algaefix is not safe for invertebrates, so if you have shrimp, snails, etc in your tank, you'll need to remove them before using it or they'll probably die. Also keep in mind that any rotting material (ie. algae or inverts that died after dosing) could lead to a decrease in oxygen levels and an ammonia spike (very dangerous for fish), so keep your aquarium test kit handy and do water changes regularly to remove the dead material. If you're using it to treat green water, I think it'd be a good idea to do a water change to remove as much of the algae as you can before you dosed the Algaefix. The more algae you remove beforehand, the less there is to kill, and the less rotting material in your tank.		I suspect that most of the negative reviews for this product come from people who had a massive algae die-off, which led to an ammonia spike and low oxygen levels, which caused their fish deaths. As I said, I used it on a tank with sensitive fish and had 0 problems.		If you're reading this review and aren't sure what I'm talking about when I mention the ammonia spike, please do an internet search for "aquarium nitrogen cycle." There is a ton of good information about fishkeeping on the internet, and keeping your fish in a clean, properly cycled aquarium will at least be a step toward helping with some algae issues.
0,I can not say enough about this harness! It fits him well and he is very comfortable! When I first got it, it was a bit big and he weighed 5 lbs now he is 6.6 it is almost perfect!
0,They work well.
0,These are the cutest PJ's ever! Love them so cute
0,got this in addition to just clipping. Very easily rounds off nails.
0,So the design and idea of this is great. I imagine it could be a great distraction to most cats but my cat just didn't buy it. To much of a constant cycle so she got bored. Its a little loud but overall I assume most cats would really like it. So easy to install
0,I bought this for my just turned year old Giant Schnauzer who weighs 95 pounds.  He did not like it at first but, after I worked with him he has been fine with it on.  He tried everything to get it off and was not successful.  It works great, he walks well on the leash (he heeled well, when he was younger but, when we adopted his older brother from a different litter, who did not know how to walk properly on a leash Schultz took on some of his bad habits) so, now he is older and much bigger, and the Gentle Leader is working awesome, I actually bought it after watching reruns of Lucky Dog.  I would highly recommend, I looked at local pet stores, and for some reason none of them carried the Purple in Large.  I received this in 2 days well packaged through Amazon Prime.
0,This works great for my red eared slider turtles. They like the variety of different foods to choose from. I like how it's a big container of food for them. It's cheaper to buy turtle food online then in the stores.
0,Based upon both my cats' reactions to this tunnel - I think they love it.  Both my cats have no issues fitting in the tunnel - the girl is 9 lbs and the boy is 12+ lbs - and even will run into from various angles.  I am not certain how much they play with the pom pom toy (except for to maybe get the others attention) as they are constantly playing with each other and the tunnel.		I chose this tunnel as it combined elements from and improved upon a few others that I considered:  I liked a leopard print one at a pet store, but it was shorter than a blue nylon one... and neither of those had a pom pom toy or two top holes (just one).  I also don't feel like it is as loud as the nylon one at the store so that is a plus.
0,I bought this as recommended on catinfo.org because I have been trying to transition my kitty to canned food from the dry kibbles (unhealthy!) he grew up on.  He had developed urinary blockages and crystals from the low moisture/high grain content in his kibbles, but was a carb junkie and hated canned food!  I had read on catinfo.org that Fortiflora has animal digest in it and is a good top sprinkle for transitioning, and it has definitely helped!  One envelope lasts 2-3 days.  My kitty loves the taste/smell of Fortiflora and sprinkling just a little on top of his wet food has him interested enough to lick it off, and he's gradually gotten less resistant to the smell and texture of the wet canned food, and after 6 weeks of gradual persistent patient trial and error, he is now eating mostly canned food!  I'm grateful there was something out there to help with the transition.
0,I love this brush, and so do all my cats!  They lined up for me to brush them.  Seems to work very well with both long and short hair.
0,Great stuff last me over a year everything in the tank eats it
0,Two thumbs up. The pills are easy to crumble in their food if you have a picky eater like I do. I also have another dog who will eat anything and he eats them outta my hand. Overall, I really like these. I have been using these for over a month now and my 11 yr old seems to be moving better.
0,GERMAN SHEPHERD	I don't have to say more. They shed 12 mos. A lot!  The Furminator hasn't solved the shedding problem, but It's great to get the undercoat out.	  No grooming tool can do better!  (And doggie loves it!)
0,My baby cakes wears a size small. These hangers fit some outfits ok while they are a little small for some outfits.
0,My dog loves these (and he's picky with treats).  This was a great price!
0,This stuff is very good. Didn't rinse it at all and put it in my 15 gallon tank. Mine smelled like sulfur when i opened the bag, as well as when I filled the tank with water. after a couple weeks the smell went away and I put in some biomax from my other aquarium to jump start the cycle. The dark color to it is nice. The plants I have in there now are all green and looking good!	I would definitely recommend this!
0,Kitty seems to LOVE her Seafood cans of food.
0,This fits my 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe perfectly and is plenty big for my 80lb German Shepherd.  I haven't washed it yet so we'll see how it holds up once I do that.		Update (10-31-2013) - I've washed and dried the seat cover several times and it has held up remarkably well.
0,Great dog food contain e r
0,Have used this for several years to feed my mix of saltwater fish (those suitable for a 28 gallon tank) such as valentino pufferfish, clownfish, cardinal fish, and red hawkfish. They seem to love it and wait patiently for me to add them in twice a day before racing to gobble them up! Only complaint I would have is that not all the pellets seem to float and sink at the same rate. Some will sink immediately and others never sink. Not a problem in general as long as you have some invertebrates to clean up your tank floor.
0,Great product. Our street is dark and lights up our black dog and where we are walking. Easy to recharge .
0,My vet recommended Pet-Tinic for my cat's anemia. I use it along with Nutri-Ved B Complex Plus Iron Liquid. It has met my expectations.
0,Works perfectly.  A little small and harder for my older eyes to read but the price was well worth it.
0,Step2 Naturally Playful Front Porch Playhouse
0,works great! No fleas or ticks and we are in Florida or the Georgia mountains most of the time
0,This is one of the best pet shampoos I have used.  It was recommended by the breeder I got my dog from as a preventative measure because Westies can develop skin problems.  Compared to other dog shampoos I have used, you only need a little to get the job done.  Which is nice, because the bottle is a bit small, and it kind of pricey, but a little goes a long way!  It smells really good too!  This dog shampoo is great for once a	month use to prevent skin problems, or to get your dogs skin problems under control.  I gave the product 5 stars because I really can't find anything wrong with it.
0,Soo super cute. My finch, Petrie got a new cage and this was one of the new accessories I just had to have. She is still getting used to her new surroundings, but I've caught her bouncing on it a few times already, she uses it like a trampoline to bounce between perches. So far A+
0,This seems like the easiest nail clippers I have ever owned for my cats. They don't try to run away when I'm cutting their nails anymore, which is super convenient
0,I tried this product for the first time over the weekend on a big area rug that my dog likes to roll on.  I vacuumed it first and then sprayed it on and let it dry.  It smelled fresher which is what I wanted.  There were no stains to work on so I can't comment on that.  I like that it is a natural product and safe for my pets and did not have a perfume smell.
0,I love this harness.  My two brussels griffons were not able to keep a collar on their necks.  This harness is the perfect answer and it is so soft that it doesn't bother them.
0,I USED THIS ON MY CARPETS AS WELL AND IT IS PERFECT FOR THOSE ODORS!
0,Nicely done, a perfect addition to my long 20 gallon.  Adds a little color and the fish like it.  I like the base too.
0,This is my second time ordering this because their size chart was off.	My cat's measurement according to their chart should be a really tight medium which is what I got the first time.	It was so big that within 10 steps of walking, one of his front paw would be out of the sleeve/hole already.	Another 10 steps the whole vest became a belt on his waist and fall off in 3 seconds.	The size small fits him really good now and it's pretty cute with the little theme going on.	Now I walk my cat everyday and the harness works pretty well even with him pulling.
0,Great item - great price - love that I don't have to clean the litterbox!  I'm super happy because I paired it with the High-Capacity litter disposal system (we have three cats and aren't always home to clean their box) and it was the perfect combination.  Quick shipping - easy to assemble.
0,Our dog went crazy over this when I gave it to her. Has a nice bounce to it and is lightweight that she can easily Carry it around in her mouth. So far have only used it indoors, but the material is easily cleanable so would be great for both indoor/outdoor use.		My dog: mini goldendoodles 22 lbs, 1 yr old
0,As described. Arrived on time. Looks great, seems well made. Have not yet put on my horse to see if it fits. I purchased medium for my half arab half quarter horse. Will update review after I put it on him. If fits, as they said it would, I'll add a star for 5 stars. After use, if it doesn't hold up, I'll deduct stars.  Update: fits horse great. Added a star.
0,These balls are great. My dog is a tough chewer and he hasn't been able to destroy them yet. It's fun to watch him play with them; the material is such when he chomps down hard enough the ball pops out of his mouth and he has to chase it across the room!  It really keeps him occupied.
0,The dogs went nuts over these.
0,I has multiple cats with ringworm and this is the first produce that really worked.  It also was easy to apply and I saw results within just a couple of day.s
0,My dogs - both picky eaters - loved this food.  I can even give it to them as 'treats'!  Highly recommend it  for its' ingredients and appeal to dogs.  Will continue to purchase.
0,My dog loves these!	Purchased them to use with the iFetch automatic ball throwing machine.  Yes they fit the small machine. They are a bit heavier and don't fly as far, but cost far less then the iFetch replacement balls
0,Just what I needed. Arrived on time
0,Dogs loved them
0,This really works well. My dogs cought on fast when given a NO command and a short hit on the air button.
0,Very well made and durable product. I was very impressed and the color looks great on my pup.
0,fine
0,my bird loves it, so I do too!!!
0,As a mom of 5 fur babies, 2 of which are tray/pad trained, indoor, 90 pound American Bullies, these pads WORK. They hold an AMAZING amount and they really do take care of the odor.
0,My dog loves this added to her food.
0,Got this for my pet turtle. Seems like a very nice light.
0,Fits very small dog nicely.
0,Mu poodle loves it, It is a bit too small for her now perhaps so I wish I bought one size bigger, but she still seems to like it.
0,I really love this dog shampoo.  It makes my dogs smell so good for several days after their bath.  Highly recommended!
0,So far our dog has not been able to damage it!!!
0,This product is the only one (and we've tried them all) that has worked for us for both flea and ticks.  I think the price is ridiculous but at least Amazon can deliver promptly.
0,Ive used Flexi leashes for many years. Theyre the best dog leashes on the market. It amazes me that people will give these leashes a one star review because they allowed their dogs to chew through them.  The leader and cord are very durable and will last a long time as long as YOU DONT ALLOW YOUR DOG TO CHEW THROUGH THEM.
0,Great value for the price. I love that I don't have to haul this thing home from the grocery store.
0,Dog loves them
0,Great alternative to Advantage II! Has worked well in last year. Much better than Frontline!
0,Bought these long ago and still using them!  Nice and sturdy and durable!
0,enjoyed by dogs of all ages.
0,another great item - recommended
0,This is pretty good quality and offers a two in one for a cat. How do they automatically know to scratch this thing? My kitten is kinda scared of the ball now but liked playing at first...he's just getting used to the place I guess.
0,We use these for all of our large dogs and for 1 of our small dogs that gobbles his food quickly...they REALLY work to slow them down. Large dogs can get bloat from gobbling their food too fast ...which is horrendous and painful and dogs can DIE from it if they don't emergency help IMMEDIATELY! So this product is worth it 100 times over to force them to slow down! We have purchased them repeatedly, so this was a very good price!
0,Great product ! a must have for bulldog owners
0,My German Shepherd is addicted to these & hasn't torn them up like a traditional tennis ball. Plus Chuckit product are MADE IN THE USA! Perfect!
0,I like this product, but my cat does not seem to play much with it, at least not yet. She loves the scratch pad in the center. Even will sit on it or lay across it. My cat likes toys that she can interact with humans. She's not a lone player so that might be it. I don't know if she uses it when I am not around, but she loves the scratch pad. I have only had this product a few days so she may need some time to get used to it.
0,Vet recommended.  Great results.  Good sale prices. Easy to dispense pills with, and our dog likes the taste of them.
0,Works well for my dog and I like that it's safe enough to give a double or even triple dose in times of high stress.
0,Works great, my German Shepherd has a tendency to escape occasionally. The reflecting qualities of this collar were important to me and they work well. Very well made and pretty! She is outside all day, and swims frequently and this collar has held up perfectly for the last two months.
0,...so now I have to buy another.  The reason for four stars?  It came squished and has not yet regained its full shape.  Regardless, one cat took to it right away.  The other about two days later!  It seems as if someone is always in it.  It is in my living room not far from the fireplace.  I think they like it there!  I have med-large (10 and 14 lbs) cats and they fit nicely as long as they don't try to share.
0,These snails are amazing to watch and are quite beautiful. See photos attached to this review.
0,I wanted to take some photos of my black cat and he was hiding somewhere (I *thought* under the bed, but I couldn't find him down there).  So, I opened a bag of this, which I had received in a cat subscription box, and scattered rather a lot of the treats on the floor.  Naturally, my calico started eating them up.  My orange tabby wanted in on them, too, but I had to lock him in the bathroom since he has inflammatory bowel disease and can't eat treats.  My black cat did come out from wherever he was and started competing with the calico to see who could get the most.  (I got my pictures.)  No idea where my tan and white boy was, but he is not particularly food-motivated.		Moral of the story, three out of my four cats really wanted these, and of the two who can actually eat them, both had probably 10-15 treats each (I kind of dropped a large handful).  They were still eager about the treats near the end of their little gorge session, and a day later, neither one of them has had any kind of digestive issues.  (My black cat really likes turkey so I'm sure that was an attraction for him.  My calico will eat anything, including bits of carpet, bugs, and potato chips, so you can't use her as a guide.)		These are soft treats, maybe 1/3 by 1/2 inch (that's a rough estimate).  They don't have a strong smell.  The pouch is resealable for freshness, though I expect I'll have given the whole bag out before long.  They drew a reluctant cat out from a secret hiding spot.  And they're grain free, which is really important in cat treats and food.  They're also made in the USA.  So I'm happy.  I originally got these in a subscription box, but would totally buy them again if I ever run out of cat treats.
0,Great for my pups and great price! Ordering bigger size next time!!!
0,My dog loves this stuff. He will run straight to his crate and lie down if he catches me looking at the bag.
0,This harness is perfect for our lil pug!  She's 13lbs & as many pug owners know their neck tends to be the issue when it comes to fit.  She is a medium in this type of harness.
0,Loved by dogs and vets alike . My very picky dog loves this food , her coat and skin look great too after using . When my vet asked what I was feeding she said it was a healthy food .
0,A little thinner than we hoped for.
0,Great little gadget! Perfect size for our boxer pup (currently 18 weeks old and 36 lbs), and will order the larger size when she's full-grown. Holds the tags securely.
0,I feed my 75 pound Alapaha Blue Blood bulldog this and he loves it. My vet recommended it cause he said since it is formulated for large breeds it can help prevent hip dysplasia or at least the severity of it. It's grain free and his coat is gorgeous and very shiny.  Definitely recommend
0,Our cat figured this out instantly. I love that there is no longer cat litter all over the floor.
0,I needed a temporary fence for a new house....just something that would contain my two mid-sized dogs until I can afford to have my entire backyard fenced. This fit my needs quite nicely. The eight sections are very easy to attach and install. I added some fence stakes to the bottom of each section to increase the stability of the fence, then attached the fence to my back porch using hooks attached to the base of the porch. Final installation is attractive and secure....pups love it!		Update as of June, 2017.....the fence has now been in place 4 months and shows no signs of rust or wear. Everyone is impressed by how well this "temporary fence" is holding up.
0,my cat loves this
0,Good product, but I wish they were smaller flakes.
0,Love Kong dog toys.  I put treats in the ends and my dog goes crazy.
0,There's not too much to say here.  These bags are a good deal if you want to use the BAG-IT receptacle system with your Littermaid cat box.  They're very thin, so you have to be carefull when you install them. You can easily tear or put holes in them.  But these work as promised and are easy to dispose of.  I actually like that they are larger than necessary because it gives you extra bag to tie off before disposal.  The price is good and these will last a long time between orders.
0,I buy this bag on a regular basis. Quality food in a easy open bag. So much cheaper than buying pet store prices and so much easier dropped off right at your door!
0,my dogs, CCresteds, love these and it helps their coats
0,Works great and charges quickly. I love how it charge both at once.
0,Nice size pieces for older cat.  Great quality food.
0,With three dogs, it can be impossible to sleep at night with all the "jingling" that one hears from the dog tags when they move about.  The Quiet Spots have been a standard in our house for a while now and we'll continue to be sure every member of our pet family has one.  The logo is a bit obnoxious, but if you can get past that, they work great.
0,My birds love the Volkman Avian Science.  It is a great blend of seeds with very little, if any, residual dust.
0,There's not much to say about this product. My dog loved it, and it kept her occupied for a long time. It's a pretty good product.
0,I used to use this in my cats litter box, it makes perfect litter and it kept the smell down so I've been mixing it with some wood shavings and I've been using in with my quail. So far so good. They're still in the brooder in the house, but I only have to refresh their bedding every other day. Once a week I dump it all in my garden and start over. I'm pleased!
0,Our cats seem to really like this stuff. I like the multi-pack... my cats seem to eat each flavor with equal gusto.
0,Our kitten loves these.
0,Really nice...
0,I ordered the small bag and my Yorkie puppy has plenty of room and room to grow. Nice bag.
0,Like others, I bought this item to use inside crates and ex-pens when at dog events. However, the "flat" side was only a little less round than the rest of the bucket. I was able to bend it a little to make it more flat but it still is far from a flat sided bucket. The sticker at the bottom of the bucket came off without any hassle and so far it has worked great, enough so that I recently purchased another bucket since the price dropped to under $9, well worth the minor flaw in my book.
0,My dogs love these. They last a while and they don't stink, which is a problem with many bully sticks. I'd buy them again.
0,I have three very small dogs and this works great to keep the yard clear. It is easy to change the bag.  If you use a large bag it will hang when you place the scooper outdoors and then you j ust change it once a day.
0,I'm very pleased with this purchase! I'm using it for my 90 lb. Greyhound and it is a good height for him. Great price for this item.
0,This shampoo kills fleas right away, during their bath. Unfortunately, they come back 4-5 days later, without a good medicine to put on them right away.  I've recommended it to many people and they've had the same results. As long as you're following up with a good flea medicine, I recommend this to anybody.
0,60lbd lab mix has been playing with it for a few months. He can destroy a tennis ball in seconds.. But barely a nic in this thing.	He does get bored of it...but we like to shove treats in the middle hole and that renews his interests.
0,durable and it looks great. Easy to put on with one click
0,My cats favorites! cheaper than in the store.
0,I bought these for my pet rabbits and they love them so much they run off with their piece so they don't have to share.
0,great product, almost scentless. great for cleaning my puppies muddy feet
0,the bench seat cover works well and for the most part fits my BMW 335 and 328 backseats.  The bottom retaining straps could be designed a bit better, though.  Also the slot for the side seat belts could be a bit deeper notched in to better accommodate the seat belt.  Other than that, it feels like a quality product and works well.
0,Works like a charm.  Wish I would quit losing them.
0,It works, fish haven't boiled or frozen so I am inclined to believe the reading.
0,These have a decent price and last about 3 months.  Big dogs are power chewers and these do hold up!
0,I bought this my chihuahuas first birthday. She looked  gorgeous  Also got one for her cousin
0,My dog loves these and they are the perfect size so he can have a few a day. One of my favorite things about fruitables is that they smell good! They don't make my dog's breath smell weird or my hands after I give them to him. This was my first time buying this flavor and my dog loves them. I also recommend the apple/bacon (same skinny mini size) and pumpkin/apple (larger sized treats).
0,arrived in good time and just a great clipper for a good price.
0,Good quality leash. Vibrant color- I bought purple and pink has lasted longer than other collars/ leashes I have purchased.
0,Just what we were looking for! This is a really great product that is going to help keep our car clean and our puppy comfortable. I would defiantly buy from these people again.
0,So far it seems to work. So happy. We will see how long the bulb lasts. Will update later
0,The open top design makes it easier to clean this litter box and the scoop will hang at the top back of the box.
0,I'm torn between the Wiki Wags and the Vet's Best for this product type. Both are perfect if you need to use a male dog wrap and don't want to be washing the non-disposables all the time. They are comparable in price and absorbency. The Wiki Wags are far superior in odor control. You can safely dispose of these in a waste basket and the trash won't stink. However, the Vet's Best edge out the Wiki Wags in fit. The small on our 19 pound terrier is just a hair too small. It wraps around his tummy but only just barely, and it is a near thing to avoid catching any of his hair in the velcro. The medium wraps around easily, but it leaves tiny gaps that enable him to dribble around the edges when he marks his territory (aka the rug) and which he does with glee. The Vet's Best medium is a perfect fit on him and does not leak at all. He shows little awareness that he's even wearing a wrap in the Vet's Best. So it's really a toss up between these two brands for me: Wiki Wags has better odor control, the other brand has better fit. Someday a third brand will come out to marry the two and I'll have my HG for this product type. Until then I'll probably make up my mind based on who has their product on sale.
0,This was a great purchase. It is well made and my husband loves it. We have two large dogs and he hated this job but now does it without a fuss. He shows everyone his newest gadget.
0,These dog harnesses are great. I don't like the idea of pulling on my dog's neck, and harnesses that clip on the back just encourage a puller to pull, so this is perfect especially if you have a strong dog you're training. We also use this harness for seat belts (you can buy straps with universal buckles online for less than $5 each) in the car.		Be aware, the harness is not meant to be worn constantly as it's supposed to be fairly snug and, particularly as your dog gets used to it, may rub or irritate their armpits. Our dogs only wear their harnesses when they're going somewhere (car ride, dog park, hike, walk, etc.), but they've comfortably worn them 12+ hours without issue.		The easiest way (we've found) to put them on/take them off is to keep the colored loop fastened and use the buckle on the black strap, which if worn correctly sits above the dog's right armpit. Simply put the colored loop over their head and reach underneath them to buckle the underbelly strap, or vice-versa to unbuckle. IMHO, it's much more difficult to get them to step into it or keep it in place to buckle 2 clips.		We had one fray and the metal ring fell off (dog-in-training's fault most likely), and the company replaced it no problem.

For people who are confused about this product weather to use it for over 20 inch aquarium. Let me tell you i had the same confusion. So initially i bought AIRO 4. But the bubbles produced by Airo 4 were too heavy. All over the aquarium it was cloudy with bubbles. Even if you control the value it was not satisfactory. But this Airo 2 is exact fit to my 26 gallon (21 inches height aquarium.)I installed at the other side of the filter. So that the bubbles won't pushed down with filter water. Now it is good. No more cloudy aquarium.
0,The dog likes it and after a week has not torn it apart yet
0,My dogs really enjoyed them and I had a question and received a very quick response from customer service.
0,My dogs love these. They seem to help with bad breath, and their teeth look fairly clean too. I never really paid much attention to my pets' dental needs, which everyone should by the way. These help with maintenance after a vet visit, and after brushing doggy teeth. They are a bit pricey though.
0,I purchased this shampoo the day I rescued my dog from a shelter. She was so stinky after we picked her up so we gave her a bath the next day. This shampoo made her coat instantly look so much better, and she didn't smell anymore! We have not experienced any skin issues after using this shampoo. It lathers up really well which makes cleaning her much easier. She smells great for a few days after her bath. We will continue to purchase this dog shampoo in the future.
0,This is easier to wash than the thunder jacket and a different material almost like swaddling
0,Works as advertised, but is tricky to put it on without the prongs digging into your dogs throat.  But if its not tight enough then obviously it will not pick up on the barks.
0,I was shocked at how much my cat loved it.  Within seconds of me taking it out of the package my cat was fascinated by it.  Not sure why I thought it came with a base, in order to play with it someone needs to either hold it or tape it to something.  Did not realize that when I got it.
0,Cats like it enough. Some cans are a lot more jello like than others.
0,I have 2 hound mix dogs who have holes in their jaws.  Water and food tends to migrate a foot from their bowls.  This is a perfect answer to this messy problem. Wish I had thought of it and patented it first!  LOL
0,I use this between shampoos (using the same product for shampoo/conditioner).  My husband comments on how good she smells and my cavachon Lola does not have any type of side-affect.  In fact, I think she likes it because my husband likes to hold her after a spray.
0,I found this online by accident when the brand i had used to buy was out. I will never buy anything else now. The birds love it (we have 11 ) & have thrived since i started feeding them the science diet. Their feathers look thicker and shinier. Their colors are more vibrant and irradecent. It even made wife happy! (Rarely do i hear a good word from her on anything i do)
0,Excellent product! Very well made and sturdy enough for our extreme chewer! I do take the balls away from him when we are finished playing; but so far he hasn't bitten through them!
0,These work really well for my cats.  I just wish they would keep still!
0,I've made several purchases from Aquatic Arts, and this has been another great purchase.  The plants arrived in great shape and are much larger than what I've gotten from other sellers.  The price is good as well.  Aquatic Arts always sends information about what you've purchased and how to make it thrive in the aquarium.
0,works, but I have to put in on her paws so she can lick it off, no other way to get her to eat it, but makes a a 5 minute free comedy show :)
0,Great price my cat tolerates this food well.  Will certainly order again if the pricing is the same.
0,We recently lost one of our dogs, and the one left behind has been suffering extreme depression and anxiety.  We used this spray in conjunction with the collar and it has been wonderful.  I highly recommend it and the collar as well.
0,Probably great for a tiny puppy, but it was much smaller than I expected.  I may return if I can--it's too small for my puppy, who is larger than others and growing fast.	Just check the size before you buy. The product itself is cute and looks well made. I'm sure a baby or a young, small dog would love it.
0,Received item quickly and was what I expected
0,Excellent, very well made thermometer. I was using the electronic variety, but I find these to be just as accurate and less expensive.
0,Needs to last longer
0,dog eats em up...
0,Great leash!  I love the padded handle.  It seems as though it will be very durable.  I bought two of the four foot long brown leashes for my dogs.  That length is perfect for city walking.
0,This ball is for this scratcher:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bergan-Turbo-Scratcher-Cat-Toy-Colors-May-Vary/dp/B000IYSAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary</a>&nbsp;in case you were wondering.		Like the tittle says, my cats love this ball, I had to buy a new one, because the freaking cats got the original out of the scratcher and I have no clue where it is...anyway, so far this new ball is doing its job, it lights up as it moves and keeps the cats happy and playing for hours (on and off).		Upon inspection however, I can see the ball is a bit fragile; because it lighst up, it can't be 100% solid, the electrical components had to placed inside of it. So if you have a dog, keep him/her from this ball, because I don't think it would survive one bite. Other than that, this is a very good purchase, keeps the cats happy and busy. I have read complaints about the battery dying out and not being able to replace it. This is true, there's no way to replace the battery, but I can see why; first of all, if we  were able to change the battery this means the ball would have to come apart and have a latch inside to lock it back together, but at the same time, cats are not exactly careful, so it could easily come apart while they play, leaving toxic electrics laying around; second of all, Bergan would lose money, if the battery could be changed, they could not sell any more balls, unless the ball breaks.		Anyway, this is still a 5 star product, its sturdiness is not as reliable as the original, but for good reason. The ball will last if kept where it is supossed to be and even rolling around the house; the battery will eventually die, but the ball will keep rolling. The original did not light up at all, so I know the cats will still enjoy this one even if the lights go out.
0,Does the job!
0,Fast shipping, good product, my dog loves it!
0,I have a 9 month old GSD, this is one of his favorite toys. This is the second one, we got the fist one, and lasted 6 months this was because at the beginning he use to chew at the cord. When he learn to play with it, became his favorite toy. I totally recommend it.
0,Really looks nice and works well. Love the material.
0,We have a very active 5-month old puppy who has destroyed most other play toys after a few days.  This one has stood up to the challenge.  We bought a larger sized Hol-ee Roller ball and inserted a tennis ball inside the larger ball.  Our puppy has a great time trying to get the tennis ball through the openings.  Thus far, the Hol-ee Roller material has withstood the chewing (1+ month of chewing).  Recommend this toy for puppies who are teething.
0,Excellent and the best thing is you can use it on a window with shades, etc, because you can easily lay it flat at night or when you need to do so.  Now my cat can sit up high for a closer look at the bird feeder outside and amuse himself for hours.
0,Works
0,My Yorkies love these. If you limit the amount you give them you will not have any problems. Do not use these as a substitute for their daily diet. This company is the best to order from. Speedy shipping and always in stock. They are made in China.
0,Update: He has discovered they are meant to be healthy and now hates them.		The cat really seemed to like these, and I used them in conjunction with drops to help with symptoms of a UTI. Priced right. Ill continue to used them to maintain urinary health.
0,I have not yet taken the stroller out of the box but only because I have been involved with other things.  I was lucky to find this particular stroller at a great price and I ordered it.
0,Nothing to fancy but gets the job done
0,My bun loved them! He chewed through almost all of them within a week.		Great price!
0,So far I been use them for a week on my 10 lbs  dog. And it been very helpful.
0,This filter works well, although it's not the most pleasing to the eye for a small tank, as it protrudes outwards from the suction cups. It's very easy to replace the cartridge which is nice, though!		One issue is that it's a loud filter, and having the tank in my bedroom is an issue. I may have to move the tank. It's an irritating sound.
0,This is BEYOND CUTE! It fits my 7-8 lb Yorkie perfectly, as with most 1pc outfits, the length is the concern. This is well made, just like anything you'd buy elsewhere. Its a great price  & most of all, it'll keep him warm while being stylishly cute on those cold winter nights. I'm already trying to find this in other (Boyish) colors!
0,Good quality and fit. Arrived in good condition and on time.
0,We have used the sporn leash since we got our dog at age 1.  what it does for our dog is prevent neck and windpipe harm.  she has back problems, being part dachshund and part beagle.  the sporn is a harness type of leash, which our vet strongly recommends for her to help protect her back from further harm, although the leash is no guarantee of that.  short of those collars that dig into a dog's neck, I don't know what will prevent a dog from pulling who is intent on it.  I think where the disappointment lies with this product for many is that the manufacturer calls the leash non-pulling, when in fact it doesn't prevent that, and that is not where its value lies.
0,Very pleased with this product. The bulldog loves it. Seems indestructable! And excellent customer service! So glad I bought this here!
0,Bought as filters for the Drinkwell Platinum Fountain. Good price and work well!
0,I haven't gotten feedback from her as of yet but she was really happy getting it. Hope she gets alot of use out of it.
0,This is the only toy that my dogs haven't chewed apart yet.  That makes it a winner in my book!
0,Really easy to put together.  Didn't take long at all.  Very sturdy and we check from time to time to see if polls need tightening.  Cats love this!  We have seven cats...watching them play on this is so much fun.  Let's them have the climbing and height that they are created for. Plus, you don't have to call the Fire department to get them out of a tree. lol  I would definitely buy again and highly recommend this item.
0,Amazing harness, last well for my 30 pound frenchie.
0,This is well made and should last for a while - not forever, as puppies have razors for teen, but a while :) Plus it is adorable
0,These are great pet vitamins for dogs and are at a great price. You will enjoy this book to read.
0,My dog thanked me after using this. She even started to lick the bottle.
0,This goes well with the Amazon Basics Dog bed. This crate is functional, and my dog loves it, but I think she would love any crate with a nice bed and toys. I can recommend this bed for a dog that does not try to escape. Just a note that I recommend you take off any collar from the dog in order to avoid the dog getting tangled with the wire crate unless you are sure your dog will be content and not try to escape. Definitely remove any choke chain.
0,Small and cute looks warm
0,Using this dumbbell to teach my 90# yellow lab to fetch.  So far so good...fetching!  This is not a chew toy, it is for training and when my trainer suggested I get one I searched many sites, most of these dumbbell s were very pricey.  When I found this one, my price range, I sent for it...not disappointed. Even my trainer is pleased with it.
0,Nylabone Big Chew Beef Bone is by far the best chew toy that we have tried primarily because it lasts for months and it occupies our dog without our involvement. We have previously bought the Nylabone Wishbone and it took our 50# dog less than a month to sharpen it to the point where I no longer felt safe giving it to him. Due to the size and the shape of this product, it provides more chewing material that so far has lasted for 3 months. At the rate that our dog is going, we should be able to get at least another 5 months out of the bone.		The other benefit of this toy is that it occupies our dog and keeps him from bugging us when we are tired and don't have the energy to play with him. With the exception of stuffed Kong, all of the other toys he has require our involvement because we need to either play tug or throw them to him in a game of fetch.		The only negative of this chew is that it leaves small plastic crumbs in places where our dog chewed the bone. Although it is harder to break off large pieces of plastic from it, occasionally our dog ends up swallowing what he manages to scrape off the bone. According to the manufacturer, pieces the size of a grain of rice or smaller should not pose any problems. And so far, most of the pieces that I noticed were much smaller than that.
0,<div id="video-block-R2KZVBV2EMBMRW" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qw-0rQPjS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1GUnlRluqS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">I have a 15 lb Shih Tzu/Bischon mix.  His neck size is 12"-13".  It's important also to know that this breeds snout is not very long.  You must measure the neck and the length of the nose from the neck to get the correct size cone.  I also got this cone for head surgeries.  He had an  eye surgery and a cyst removed from the top of his head. I cannot comment on how well this cone would have worked if he would have had to try and stay away from any body part located behind his head.  I learned a lot from his first eye surgery the month before.  I had one of the regular plastic cones and he was miserable!  Wouldn't move, couldn't get comfortable, kept knocking into things.  I knew we weren't going to go the plastic cone route again for his next surgery so I started shopping around.  I chose this one over another similar one over the comments that the other looked soft, but was still too stiff and hard.  This one has three different size settings around the neck that worked out very well.  The velcro tab that you can pull back for them to eat also works out fairly well, not perfect but, a very good feature to give it a shot over not having it at all.  May work for some, others not so much.  But, I'm glad it was there to try.  It happened to work out for my dog for eating.  The velcro does tend to rotate to the top since the other velcro strips are heavier and naturally gravitate down.  No problem, just rotate back around when needed. It also comes with a collar attachment that I chose not to use.  The outside of the cone has a very nice reflective strip that shines nicely in the dark if you shed any kind of light on it. One suggestion I would have for anyone who knows ahead of time that they'll be needing a cone is to get it before hand and get them used to wearing it.  For his second surgery I made this cone be the next best thing to Heaven.  I started out by letting him sniff it and when he sniffed it I gave him a small treat.  I then velcroed it and when he put his head willingly through the hole I rewarded him with a treat, then we graduated to just leaving it on for short periods and his reward was playing catch with the ball to finally just leaving it on for awhile and letting him learn how to put his head down comfortably.  On the day of his surgery I brought the cone out to give to the Vet and my dog got up on his back hind legs begging to have it put on!  Bottom line, I thought this cone was perfect for my dog's needs.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
0,My dog seems to like it.  He never uses the pillow part though.  German Shepherd dog. Ps.  Dog hair will show instantly  on this.
0,This is my dogs favorite ball to fetch in the world. It has a small hole in it to let off a slight whistle so the dog not only sees the ball but can hear where it is. He can chew and chew and it does not fall apart. No squeaker to fall out. My dog is 60 lbs, so unless we lose it, he is happy for a good long time.
0,Its a nice collar to keep the dog from pulling and it works well
0,I have purchased these twice and will continue to purchase. My Brittany Spaniel had a bad case of itchy skin. After giving him this product daily in his morning feed... No more chronic scratching. Would highly recommend, and will purchase again.
0,really small
0,I can't say enough good things about tjis. I'm so glad my little one has this. Proven sturdy enough to hold our cat on top..... and keep the guinea safe. Everything comes with it that you'll need so you're ready to go! The little blue water bottle is there to get her accustomed to the bigger one as she grows
0,cat food...what can one say
0,I've been using now for a month.  My dog has in the past escaped out of harnesses. With the 3 peice I hook the collar to the harness and we have successful walks
0,Works great.  The dogs always come when I blow the whistle.  It doesn't seem to hurt their ears just gets their attention.
0,Good Thank you
0,Khan is Awesome.
0,This is the perfect size for my cat, and fits well even in my small apartment. It hides the waste from view, and helps keep the litter inside the box better than a conventional litter box.		My cat had no problem transitioning to this box from a regular litter box - I just let her get used to it with the lid off for a few days, before putting the lid on and using as it's meant to be used.
0,I like that this fly mask is soft and not that rigid material, specially around the ears.
0,long and sturdy, the bulb cover for the leash end is weird
0,Good quality!
0,This is the best quality hay that I have ever purchased in a bag in the last ten years. Tremendous value, size is equivalent to about 3 of the small pets tore type bags, and the hay is lovely. Fresh and fragrant, leafy with tops, not primarily stems and coarse bits that small pets find unappetizing, but the good stuff that they will gobble up. Pleasantly surprised and so happy with this purchase.
0,This is a great little sponge filter; I'm using mine in a little 5 gallon and it works great. It does take up about 1/3, maybe 1/4 of the tank, I see this filter more suited to a 10 gallon +. I bought this filter for my fry tank and it has done a great job, I've actually just ordered another one as supplemental filtration for another tank and would definitely recommend it if you need a basic sponge filter.
0,My 70 lb Golden Lab can't get enough of these! He has a lot of allergies, and these treats are perfect for him. They are the perfect, square size, and seem very moist. I'll definitely buy these again.
0,Whimsical. I just wanted a red scoop but no complaints.
0,I have a big cat and this box is great for him! No mess and keeps the smell to a minimum.
0,My Dane pups can destroy just about anything.  Not the Wobbler!  I've purchased several, as they are tough enough to withstand rough play, keep the dogs very engaged, and help stimulate their minds, which is vital to teens.  The destruction of other toys has greatly reduced with the introduction of the Wobbler.  Love it and highly recommend for giant and large breed pups and teens.
0,It's a great bowl for hiking trips. It folds easy and stays open when I need it too. So far I haven't had any problems with it leaking.
0,I have used this with my rabbits several times. They both fit in when they were small, now one still fits in at a time quite well.
0,Looks delicious and my Conure seems to be enjoying it.
0,The turtles don't love it alone but when I mix it with water and put it over their greens, like dressing. They eat it
0,Got the wrong size but decided to donate them to shelter.  They always request these collars so they don't have dogs slipping out of collars.
0,does the job
0,The kids love it.
0,My Schnauzers like these treats. They are small so you don't have to worry so much about putting on too much weight. I trust Hill's Science Diet	dog food and treats to be a premium quality product. I would highly recommend Science Diet to anyone who wants the best nutrition for their	pets.
0,My dog loves these and the duck recipe is good for his renal problems.  He will do anything to get these as his reward.  I break them into bite size pieces since he gets them about 6- 8 times a day.
0,Cleaning the cat box, and finding a non smelly location is not easy.  Purchased the Genie system, and wish I would have done so sooner.  Love it. So easy to use, and hides the smell.  Very nice, especially when you have 2 kitties.  No smell in the house.  I do recommend this.
0,over the access point on one end and the easy entry and exit of the other end.  sturdy
0,Doggies loves these. They don't hold up great, but I'm fine with that because they are so cheap.
0,Puppies enjoyed these! Good you!
0,It make her feel secure and calm
0,The product is exactly as advertised, high quality, and fits perfectly in my midsize sedan. I got the black color, nice workmanship and fits perfectly with my black leather interior and very easy to install. Nice bonus receiving two harnesses of different sizes. I reached out to the seller regarding a question I had and received a very quick response. Excellent follow-up. Thank you, Karen!
0,Unless you're willing to go for the "turtle topper" by the same company, this is the only other dock you should buy! My RES is about 3.5 inches and this is the perfect size for him. (I would assume the corner model would be great for less than 3 inch turtles. Seems this will last until he is well over 5 inches, and once he outgrows this I will upgrade to the topper.) Platform arrived this morning and installation was fairly simple. Make sure to rinse off ALL of the parts and even soak in warm water for a while. I also let the finished product sit in the tank water with filter and basking light on for about 6 hours before returning the turtle to his tank. Always check the temperature under the basking lamp! There is plenty of room to swim under and around this platform. My brave little guy made the climb to the top after only about an hour.  He is definitely happy  =)
0,I love dry shampoo in between washes. This one smells really good
0,Pup seems to really like it.
0,Fantastic chew stick. Put them in the freezer to add a bit more "chew" to the treat. Great before bed snack
0,These are the only dog snacks that my dod actually likes and they work G R E A T!!!  Love....
0,Haven't tried them , yet.  Will give another review later.
0,These are a great price.  Much larger than expected.  I have a 40 gallon breeder tank and a baby bearded dragon in it. Two next to each other take up the entire side of the tank.  Lots of room for food.  Can not beat the price.
0,After my dog left teeth marks in the original Kong, I switched to the extreme version.  It is much more durable than the original.  Still not interesting to my dog unless it has food in it, but serves it's purpose well.
0,I have a very elderly cat - Shirley is around 18, though she might be a tad older - who is just losing weight that she can't afford to lose. So at the suggestion of my daughter I have taken to giving her wet food two to three times a day. Right now I am feeding her this Nutro product, with excellent results. My two cats have  been self-feeders for a long time, but the younger one is far more aggressive in going after food. So I've been taking my senior girl and putting her in a room by herself with this wet food. After a half hour I let her out and put the food away. She usually eats only around half of the container. Later in the day I take it out and put the food on a microwaveable plate and microwave it for about 12 seconds. It helps her to smell the food and whets her appetite (at age 18 she doesn't smell things as well as she used to). Gradually she has regained a pound or two. She has always been an incredibly tiny cat, so gaining a pound is a huge improvement. I don't use only Nutro, but it is definitely one of the foods she likes a lot. I like to use two or three kinds of wet food and alternate them to keep her interest up. If I can just keep her from losing weight I see no reason why she shouldn't make it to age 19 or even . . . dare I say it? . . . 20? But I'm grateful that there are high quality foods like this. By the way, I also love their dog food, both wet and dry. I think Nutro is a brand that pet owners can trust.
0,First off, I will tell you that I have a dog who has very strong and distinct anxieties, and nail trimming has always been one of them.  The look, sound, and feel of clippers has always made her extremely nervous (panting, drooling, whining, pulling her feet away, etc.) regardless of any number of tactics I have tried to make it a rewarding, pleasant experience with her (treats, reassurance, belly rubs, only clip a couple nails at a time, stopping when she pulls away, etc.)  But the fact of the matter is she HAS to have her nails clipped, and it was getting really expensive to have the vet do it each time.		So, I ordered this with very high hopes after reading the wonderful reviews.  I think this is the Cadillac of nail filing devices, and I am so very impressed with how well it works.  However, it just was NOT okay with my dog.  I used advice from other reviewers and tried to acclimate her VERY slowly with the device itself, then let her experience the sound and the feel of the non-grinding end when it was on.  Whenever she showed signs of distress, I would stop, praise her, and resolve to try again later.  But the truth is that she hates this filer.  She displayed all signs of extreme distress before it even touched her paws.  No amount of coaxing or soothing or slow-but-steady behaviors are going to change that.  I managed to file a few of her nails, and the tool does an AMAZING job... but it was NOT a positive experience for either of us.  So I write all of this to say: ultimately, you know your dog.  You know her anxieties and idiosyncrasies.  If she is afraid of mechanical noises (e.g., the vaccuum or blowdryer), this may not work for you. (The device is NOT very loud at all, but the whirring sounds are definitely mechanical, and your dog may attribute that to similar sounds.)  If she hates nail clipping time, this may not work for you.  If she gets visibly nervous or anxious around grooming time (e.g., hair cuts, baths, etc.), this may not work for you.  It is not a miracle tool that will make the most timid dog sit down and enjoy a relaxing pedicure.  I do believe that this is most definitely a superior product - just not right for all dogs.
0,I was skeptical of these at first, but once in the tank for awhile, they loosen up and start to look more natural. I would scrub them before putting them in the aquarium however. Just in case any plastic pieces come off.
0,This product really helped solving a big issue with my dog digestive system. One small measuring cup for each cup of dog food is all you need.
0,my chins love it. There is no dripping, no leaking or whatsoever at all! worth the money.
0,7week tiny toy poodle loves!  No tummy transition trouble.  Very pleased
0,Our cats love this. We have indoor cats, and I noticed that they were starting to chew off bits of some faux plants of mine. So I figured they needed some greens. These are easy to set up, and take a few days to grow. My only complaints are that my cats love it so much, they will pull the little plants out of the tray and make a mess. Also, it tends to grow mold after a few days.
0,Wow this Wow this really works.  I was skeptical  at first. I have tried all the get the dog urine smell products out there and from natural remedies to over powering smelling items all seem to leave a slight urine smell behind.  And when shampooing my carpets the smell just would get so strong that it made you sick! So yesterday I load up my machine and head to try yet another product on my floors and knowing as soon. As the floor gets wet I am going to smell urine so bad that it will make my stomach turn. But it didn't happen! I waited and waited still no smell... now I will say the worst area has a slight smell still but the amount is 90% better after another application I believe it will be gone. This product will become a must have at my home. Also the fact it is natural and safe also really tops my list. I honestly hate harsh nasty chemicals  and using them around my children, animals, home and self.  Highly recommend!
0,The best teething toy!  I am a little concerned about the edges being slightly to sharp, but overall she loves it.
0,Item is as described and was delivered on time without delays. Fantastic helpers for litter pan.
0,Love it.  My yorkshire terrier loves to ride in it and sleep.  Secure fit and durable.  Soft and comfortable with plenty of room for her to sleep in.  She weighs 9 lbs and has room to spare.
0,the dog and the bird love playing tug of war with this toy
0,My Kuzco loves it! He tears up toys so easily so I thought ide get him one He can't but sadly he has already torn off  the fabric around the bone, oh well tho.	It's a little small but he is a small chiwinnie so it's fine
0,My poodles say thank you! Their eyes feel a lot better!
0,i just love this portable pet food tote.		You can see it from various angles on the Amazon site, but let me describe it. The main body is a clear plastic jar where you put your dog's food. You seal that with the large black plastic top.		If you want to take the water along with you there is a smaller (and seemingly dishwasher safe) plastic container that has its own top - also black with a doggy bone decoration on top. This container slips inside on top of the food container, thus separating the water from the food. You then put the big plastic lid over that, and you've got it all - and airtight. Then, you put on lightweight blue plastic bowls that attach at both ends - if you want. There are handles on both the large plastic container, and ones that attach to the blue bowls, so it's up to you and easily carried with or without the separate feeding/drinking bowls.		The plusses are that it is super light, which is key. The real weight is just going to be the water and food. Plus, it's so compact which makes it easy enough to take along with you.		My only concern is that it looks like you should hand-wash the food container, since I'm not sure it would retain it's same shape under dishwasher heat. If it becomes misshapen at all, it will not be an airtight closure.		I highly recommend this pet food/water tote, since it's so light and small. I will definitely come back and report back on its durability  - but for now I give it a resounding thumb's up.
0,This is a great carrier for my daughters hedgehog. She likes to bring her hedgehog to Memaw's house.
0,Our dog loves this toy!
0,This is my cat's favorite toy.  She won't play with anything else.
0,My pacific parrotlet loves chewing on the ladder, but has not damaged it yet, so A+!
0,Extremelly helpfull by ours apartament... puppy always use it!
0,These are really nice got them for our cat could cut a lot thicker nails do very well
0,My dogs loves these hide n seek toys. There are several components to these toys including the habitat and the actual animals. The animals are able to come out of the stump and can be put back in for more hide n seek fun. My dogs can destroy toys very easily but this one has lasted a few months already (which is more than I can say about most). I cant wait to buy my dogs more toys like these for Christmas
0,This backpack is adorable on our 30lbs mutt! It's very nice that the portion of the backpack with the pockets is velcro-d so that you can easily remove it to grab something or for loading/unloading. A major bargain for a good quality item.
0,Quality dog food, made in the USA from responsible sources.		Our medium sized doodle likes this canned food & it doesn't cause her any problems.  Hold your cursor over Amazon's product photos to read the ingredients & feeding instructions.	Dog Food Advisor rates Canidae Grain Free Pure Wet Food Elements at 4 stars.	I am comfortable feeding this canned food to our precious doodle.
0,I love this toy.  Not only is he cute but he is squeaky allover and he is long enough for both of my dogs to play with at once.  It is not so important that i like him but that they do and they do!
0,Slows him down some, which is good.  I expected this to be an insert for the regular dog bowl, my bad, guess I didn't read the description well enough.  Despite my skepticism, because it is soft and flexible, it works well.  Four stars because you need both hands to transport it from counter to floor unless you want to spill, or have a large hand.  Haven't tried the travel bowl, but expect limited use because my puppy is growing up to be a big lab.  Bowl will be small for him...
0,Great product.
0,This chicken was love at first sight for my 17 lb. Jack Russell terrier! The chicken is very soft, which a plus because I adopted her last year at the age of 10 and she has dental disease because she'd never been examined by a vet, and other health issues have to be addressed before she can safely undergo anesthesia. I have to be selective when picking toys in order to protect her gums. As noted in the description the toy is large, about a foot long, but it's so squishy and light enough for her to easily run around the yard while shaking it.	I gave this toy 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons. She's had the chicken for about 3 months and she's already pulled the legs off, so maybe there's a way they could be attached more securely. The squeaker is the other reason; it moves around in the body section and is very hard to squeeze, even when I try.
0,Works extremely well!  Not as dangerous as the furminator which ended up giving my dog a tiny nick.  It was totally my fault but still made me feel terrible.  I rather use this during the heavy shedding since I can use it every day and not worry about hurting my dog by accident.  I love to see how much fur it removed after each brushing by retracting the bristles and just taking the hair off effortlessly.
0,Great harness for small dogs.
0,works great i use this on my dog and cat it doesn't hurt them and helps a lot
0,My oldest of 3 cats won't touch it.
0,My dog sleeps with this ball in his mouth, would jump out of a car window to get it.  He loves this ball and does not destroy it (he tries) and he destroys everything.  He can kill a tennis ball in 20 seconds, but these balls have lasted for months, until he loses it.  He likes to carry the ball in his mouth when he walks.  It is the greatest.
0,They're all natural and have a nice fresh smell. I haven't found anything I don't like from Earth Friendly Products, and I've tried a lot. My favorite is the Lemongrass Eco Breeze, which I've started spraying on puppy as it too (of course) is all natural. I think they're a nice size, being that you don't always have a bunch of mud to clean off and it would be a waste otherwise and they're a big fan of conservation. For bigger jobs, use 2 and don't feel bad about it; the price is awesome!
0,Just got it and haven't gotten to walk the dog with it.  I tried it on (!) and think it will work.  I hurt my shoulder on my dog walking arm and have had nothing but trouble walking my 80 lb yellow lab since.  She's good, but does require some control (short attention span).  Am hoping this will solve the problem.
0,I bought this for my dog (bull terrier mix) who is a power-chewer because it was made in USA. Checking out, the cashier said it was the best dog toy ever and told how his dog (boxer) had not been able to destroy this ball like he did with all other toys. I understand now. My Charlie also can pulverize toys, but... not this one! He has chewed and chewed and chewed. After over 2 years now, it has teeth imprints but is still intact and chewable. I buy them now for all the dogs I know who are power chewers.
0,Good behavior treat for my dog
0,The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews are really great for keeping your dog's breath fresh.  My dogs love them more than any other treats we have tried.
0,My dogs love anything by Cloud Star, especially the softer treats, and these pumpkin & ginger treats are no different. My two Chesapeake's go crazy for them. They know exactly where I keep the bag hidden! I also like that the pumpkin/ginger combo is good for their tummies. I've used this combination often whenever one has intestinal issues and it works like a charm. Bottom line these are great treats, from a good company!
0,If you have a Dachshund puppy it is the ONLY puppy food to use. We have 3 (yes, 3 Dachshund puppies) and they love it. Our Vet recommended it,	primarily for the additional nutrition needed for a long back.
0,So far this seems to be a very effective carrier for our cats. No one managed to break loose, yet! :)		It's easy to use, and seems durable.		I really like the added ventilation on the sides, in our hot climate. It's much safer for the cats being transported, and they can really see what is around them. If you want to reduce their view, just toss a piece of sheeting or thin towel over the top, to hang over the sides. They will still be able to get some air circulation. The handle on the top makes it easy to transport them without getting scratched or bitten.		I would definitely recommend this product to cat lovers.
0,Works wonderful.
0,great buy for picky eaters- both  grass Finch and Cockatiels-fresh, no waste
0,Amazing! very well constructed. Works very well, and probably the best I've ever used.
0,These have lasted for a few years and my dog is a powerful chewer.
0,My guppy and molly fries loveeee it!! Great product for anyone who currently have newborn fries. The food particle basically breaks into tiny pieces when submerges into water that allow for fry to ingested it.
0,Not the strongest crate I have, but serves its purpose, since it fits under the RV table.
0,Kitties love it!
0,Very dependable and my two dogs a Labrador and a bulldog both eat the same food and they excel with it.
0,So happy with the purchase. My pet is 5LB chihuahua. Glad to find something not to heavy and fit perfectly!! Super easy to put it on and tight enough for small size dog like my pet. She is walking fine with it and got lots of compliments:)
0,My two pitbulls love it and they haven't been able to destroy it ! They love trying to get the treats out of it
0,Fits perfectly on my "Top Fin" 28 gallon bowfront. No misalignment of any sort. Good quality, looks great.		It is intended for the Marineland/Perfecto Euro 28, and is unlikely to fit other brands. (My "Top Fin" is really a Marineland.) if you don't know your tank's maker, look for Marineland/Perfecto's trademark anchor symbol somewhere under the frame behind the glass. Other clues are a wide center brace and 12" flat side panels, not 10" as used by All Glass/Aqueon, the other bowfront commonly found in this approximate size. Amazon sells tops for the latter, too.		The supplier ships promptly, and really earns its shipping fee. The manufacturer's  cardboard packaging was surrounded by double layers of bubble wrap and air pillows inside a large cardboard box.		That Fish Place seems to be the only source that consistently stocks this cover, but it occasionally can be found elsewhere. Other suppliers often gouge on shipping and/or won't guarantee against breakage in transit. That Fish Place charges a fair price, offers excellent customer service and is referenced by Marineland when customers ask where to find these covers. Highly recommended.
0,What can we kitty owners do when our cats choose to only eat pricy products? My cats only fancy feast elegant entree and only 4 or 5 of these types. This is one of their favorites. The vet from NY Humane Society on 59th Street said, "Well for commercial foods, this is the best, so although I'd like Starr to have something better if she refuses to eat (kitty is skinny) then let her eat. It has less ash than most and is better made." So I agree and let the kitties eat what they like and the vet says ok! Occasionally I purchase elsewhere for bargains, but it is hard to get a better bargain and it is very convenient to have it sent on a schedule. I've got 4 hungry cats, Starr is only 6 1/2 pounds, Cleo is 7 1/2, Davie is 9 and Big Boy Mushka is 14 - he's a British Blue. He eats the most. They are all spoiled! They love the elegant medleys but basically only want the tuna or chicken.
0,Love Lupine, always such great quality and this collar is as great as expected. Vibrant colors, well made, love it!
0,I really like this quilted cover for my backseat. I drive a Prius, and my two dogs (pit bull and jack Russell mix) are quite the slobber fiends and fur dispensers.	I previously had one of those canvas covers for my backseat which ripped easily with my 85lb pit bull on top of it.	This is well-made with what looks like quality materials. I purchased the grey/gray color to go with my black interior, and while it does show my dog's fur, it is not nearly as unattractive as the canvas cousin. If my dogs weren't so hairy and slobbery I could probably leave this on the seat while passengers sit there too, that's how nice it is.	I especially like that there are bungee-like straps that go under the seat cushions to hold this in place. You can see one in the main photo right on the bottom. Those straps are so helpful.	Overall, I'm very pleased and would recommend this to anyone!
0,Excellent service!  Thanks so very much!  My dog will take any kind of pills with these! !  They're awesome!
0,AWESOME product.. i actually see a difference in my 12 year old Blue Healer.. SUPER product
0,Cat likes and eats enthusiastically.
0,The cats love this bed.  Already have one in a crate so bought thid pad for them to lounge around on and they love it!
0,super strong will do the trick. cables are nice instead of your dog lugging around a heavy chain. very well made, much stronger than the local cables i've had that have broke and rusted out and had there hooks stick. keeps my GSD safe.
0,My Border Collie loves these. We don't mind giving our pet these bars as a treat as they have quality and nutritional content baked it. We're very fussy with the food we give our pet. These bars met our standards and out 4 legged friended agrees.
0,Best dog food I have come across for a dog with allergies and and issues with rice and grain.  My dog also likes the small bites now that she is older and her teeth are not as good.
0,Our lab loves getting his teeth brushed and this does both sides at once, creative idea
0,My cat goes crazy for it, and it's easy to handle because it's short. I find the fishpole style toys end up falling apart quickly, so this is great.
0,It makes playing with my dog much easier as I have a bad shoulder and this operates with a mere flick of the wrist.
0,My two Dachshunds love this. It lifts them up so they are able to see out the window, it's comfy, well made, I love that it buckles in like a child's car seat and has the tethers. We bought the large size and it has two tethers, perfect for two small-medium dogs to share.
0,Cats are obligate carnivores -- They Must Eat Meat. Cats are not built to digest soy, corn, rice, wheat, potatoes, carrageenan, guar gum or any of the other crap you find in supermarket brands of canned food. And dried kibble is AWFUL for cats. Their bodies utilize so much of their internal fluids to digest kibble that it stresses their kidneys. Feeding your cat kibble every day (even the so-called grain-free brands) eventually leads to CKD (chronic kidney disease), then renal failure. (Which I learned the hard way.) But grains/carbs are cheap & dry kibble is convenient. The pet food industry counts on the fact that most veterinarians -- & pet owners -- are woefully uninformed about proper nutrition for pets. (Much like doctors are uninformed about proper nutrition for humans.) A BARF (bones & raw food or biologically-approproate raw food) diet is the healthiest, most nutritious diet for both dogs & cats. (Learn more about that at CatInfo.org.) Primal Nuggets provides raw, freeze-dried BARF that offers both convenience & a healthful diet for your dog or cat. Yes it's expensive -- the good stuff always is. Either you spend the extra $$ from Day 1 to feed your pets right from the start, or spend it later at the vet's office when they get diabetes or CKD after 5 or 6 years.
0,Great price, quick service -- works great for our ball python.
0,Love the color.  So bright with a fun design.  They fit my dogs great!
0,Well made and durable if used as intended (NOT as a chew toy), however I can't get my dogs esp. interested in playing tug of war.  Not the fault of the product in the least, I'm sure, but I thought it would be more of a hit than it's proven to be.
0,This thing is gigantic!  My dog is 35 pounds and I thought this would be a good bone for her to last a while.  She can't even lift this monstrous thing!  She still likes it though.  Been working on it for about 3 months now and it is still the same size as when we bought it.  Recommended for very large dogs only.
0,The quality on this crate is amazing. It is very heavy and sturdy. I'm actually using it for one of my cats (I need 1 more crate for another cat) for when I move. I need to "capture"them  2-3 days before moving day since two of them are master hiders, one of them loving to spend time on top of the duct work in the basement. Just try and get an unwilling feline down from there. So I wanted to put them in a cage for a few days so I don't have the excess worry of having to capture them as things get crazy. This crate is a bit small lengthwise for my purposes, since I wanted to put a carrier inside the crate as well so Paloma or Calvin will go inside the carrier willingly on moving day (cats feel more secure in secluded areas). I can close the carrier door, and then move them in just the carrier (the crate itself is too large). It will only fit my smallest carrier plus a teeny litterbox that I will put in there a few times a day. I plan on purchasing a 36 inch crate for the second cat. Anyway, this is just an idea for cat owners on how these crates can also be used for them. I know once I move it will also come in handy because I plan to foster both cats and dogs.
0,My dogs give these 5 stars. Yummy and crunchy!
0,After breaking our #20 plastic bag holder (give or take), I was looking for something a bit more durable.  Although it looks a little weird, this is a great bag holder.  It doesn't break, it doesn't swing around, and the strap hasn't come loose in a couple hundred walks.  Also, you can stick a few extra bags in the bottom as a reserve in case you unexpectedly run out, and it doesn't clank around like the plastic ones.  Totally worth it.
0,My dog just loves these chews. It's the first thing he wants in the morning. I think they help keep his teeth clean in between cleanings at the vet. You save at least half buying them from Anazon versus the big pet supply chains.
0,Cat goes nuts for these things. He'll even come running when I know he's already full. I once saw a look of uncertainty on his face while he considered weather he was too full or not, ultimately giving in and eating them all.
0,great leash. until I accidentally left it on and my dog chewed it. bought another!	the small size allows for good control during walks and for training.
0,Success!  Dog loves it.  She's the same color as the bed, so I do not notice the hair static like other reviews described.  She's 65lb American staffordshire and we ordered the large 40".  It is oval shaped, so her legs hang off if she lays in it short ways, but way more space if she lays in it properly.  No zipper for cleaning.  For th price, I like it.
0,My pup has arthritus and the SinoviG3 helps in reducing the pain. He also enjoys it as an excellent treat and looks forward to taking it.
0,It sticks to itself, supports my arch better than a standard ace bandage and with much less bulk.  Best of all it's purple!  Also worked well holding my Lab's cut pad together while hiking.
0,Love this leash. Beautiful blue color!
0,I have the drinkwell 360 and with 3 cats, having clean water can be a challenge. I like these filters because they are easy to use and keep the water filtered and clean for a week.
0,Perfect harness soft and comfortable for my Yorkie
0,Works great to create a natural light cycle for my seahorse aquarium. Ramp up and ramp down with two channels makes them act much more natural than just turning the lights on and off.
0,My cats love this stuff because it has gravy.
0,My mini schnauzer is on a raw freeze dried food that is rehydrated with water...needless to say the meat juice and particles get trapped in her beard. If not cleaned/washed she stinks like a dead animal, gross! It's not fun for her (or me) to wash her beard after every meal so I tried this waterless shampoo. I figured if it's safe to use all over a cat and they lick themselves, it would be a much safer option than dog waterless shampoo since her beard dips in her water bowl. We love the scent too! Others I've tried had an overpowering smell this is a nice subtle clean smell.
0,We got one each for our two greyhounds.  Have had them for almost a year.  They were surprisingly durable -- they're torn open at this point and the squeakers don't work.  But our dogs loved them.  They've been through the wash and came out decent.
0,Great shampoo that leaves my dogs clean and smelling good.
0,I think I like it more than the cat does although it's not her fault. At the same time I got her a cat tree with beds and so she's way more interested in that. Sometimes I find her perching on the scratcher about to hop on something but overall it seems to be a very good quality item that doubles as a decoration.
0,This was exactly what I need for my dog to stay off the counter and to stop stealing food!		My complaint is that it does not warn before it shocks. I always test something before I use it on my dog so I understand how strong it is, and this will just beep and shock there is no option to beep only, or beep for 20 seconds and then shock. Really if I wasn't so happy with how well it worked to keep the dog away I would rate it much lower. But because my dog has an invisible fence all I had to do was show him that if he gets close it will beep.
0,Use this daily on my three house cats and find fleas.came quickly
0,The dog diaper covers are well made. They have smooth seams and fit my 26 lb shelty nicely. I purchased a large per the measurements and expected it to be a bit big. By the time you add a diaper or poise pad it fit her perfect. I definately advise to buy one size larger than described. There is extra length of velcro to adjust. you can always tighten. I like the solid color but wish both were black to avoid drawing attention to them. I especially like that they didn't have and prints on them. My dog didn't react to them in any negative way. I did check that the binding was not rubbing her legs. She jumped up and trotted off. I paid full price for this product. It was not part of my reviews for reduced cost.
0,Nice hut! No issues
0,First of all there seems to be two different models of this cage being reviewed.  The Newer version DOES NOT have a center divider on the floor, so the rabbit can lie down anywhere.  Secondly it seems like they beefed up the plastic bottom and made it much more sturdier, so it has very little flex in it.  At the same time they decreased the shipping box size by changing the way the metal section is put together.		The cage comes in a fairly big but fairly flat box (about 8" thick).  Inside are all the components pictured, the metal section folds out and then is clipped together in the corners and then rested onto the bottom plastic tray via slots and then held in place with two latches on the far sides.		While the old cage that is pictured has six wheels the new one only has 4 wheels, the two middle ones do not exist on the 43" model I received and I think that's because the bottom is now much more sturdier.		All together it took about 15-20 minutes to assemble and was a very nice project for myself and my Son to work on.		I really like the way they designed the cage for cleaning.  All you do is pull the two metal clips on the sides and then lift off the whole metal cage and then put the Rabbit or guinea pigs in a temporary box.  Then you just lift up the blue plastic bottom and tilt it into the outdoor garbage bin and pour out all the dirty straw and wipe the bottom clean.  Next rinse and clean the bottom part with soap and water, dry it off and refill with fresh straw and pop back on the metal top which is still holding the ladder and all other attachments in place.  The whole process took me 15 minutes and was painless.  I cannot imagine a simpler process for cleaning out a cage of this size.		I only have two issues with the cage.  If your keeping Rabbits like we are, this cage can hold two but it seems just a tad too cramped for two of them so you may want to consider just one.  For guinea pigs you could hold several in the cage without an issue.  Forget Hamsters, they would most likely be able to slip through the bars and I assume that's why they are not mentioned by the manufacturer.	My second issue is the water bottle, it kind of feels like the mounting of it was an after thought.  Don't get me wrong it works fine but I don't know how long the twisted wire strap will last.  I would have preferred a more robust Clip system that held the bottle at two points instead of just one.		Overall it's a fantastic cage and is well thought out in regards to the animals comfort and easy cleaning.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a nice indoor cage.
0,My cats go insane for this, but the battery compartment is kept shut by a screw...which makes battery replacement a pain. It would be better IMO if it was a clip compartment or the door slid off...like almost every other battery operated device in existence.
0,I got a medium and its too big on my 8 pound Maltese dog. When he pees, it gets in the sweater, If that helps for sizes.
0,Huge hit with the dog.  He absolutely loves it.  It's easy to catch, has a nice squeaker - what's not to love.  I only gave it 4 stars because I've had to stitch up a couple of seams in the first week.  Our dog is a player, not a destroyer, so I hoped for a little better durability.  My stitch job seems to be holding up though.
0,My dog loves it.  Rusty gives Kiwi 4 paws up!
0,We are on our third one now not because of the quality but because our dog things it's a chew toy.  I'm able to throw a ball pretty far with this and keeps my dog entertained
0,dog love the food!!!! :D
0,Better yet, my dog loves it.  He loves sweaters.  It does run VERY small, though.  I bought X-Large for my 30 lb Beagle/JRT mix and it is just a little big on him, but covers his butt, which he appreciates.  It also has straps that secure the back around his back legs, and he doesn't mind them a bit.  A nice added touch since it tends to "roll up" without the straps in place.  Nice bright red which keeps him visible outdoors.
0,My dog loves them but gives him gas. I renamed these "FART STICKS" . HAHA
0,My magnesium was very low... I dosed a couple days and it has maintained now for over a month
0,Great prices and good quality
0,My ShihTzu are picky eaters and will pick out the fresh chicken or turkey that I add to this blend of IAMS dog food, so I end up throwing out most  servings each night. I didn't mind throwing it out because this blend was reasonably priced, but the vendor has tripled the price of this blend since I last purchased it, so I'm on the hunt for another quality, but reasonably priced food that doesn't hurt my wallet as much when I have to throw it out.
0,Good quality. Nice size snack. My dog loves em! He does love just about everything however. He especially loves them as a bedtime snack... runs to bed and waits for his snack as soon as he sees me reach for them.
0,At first my 3 dogs really liked this dog food, but after about a week one of them seemed to lose interest (in fairness, he is the pickiest eater) and went back to his regular food.  I like the fact that this product is grain free.  It is also a natural color and doesn't have that smell that some dry dog food has when you open the bag.  I am waiting to see if the other 2 dogs continue liking this food.  It is hard to find something they all like - but 2 out of 3 is still pretty good.
0,AWESOME PRICE!  Arrived quickly.
0,After getting tired of buying leads from the big box pet stores, only for them to fail/tear apart, I decided to try Amazon. The Lupine Leashes are of the same material as many of the leads you'll find at your local pet stores/Wally Mart. The lead is of a two piece construction, black material looped with a metal latch to the lead, the 3/4 and 1" thick leads have a real easy to latch clip for attaching the lead to the collar. Where as the 1/2" thick lead has the standard thumb pull/press latch. The difference between this lead and all others is the warranty/guarantee; LIFETIME, even if you have a pet who chews through the leash! You can go to lupinepet dot com, they have the guarantee on the bottom of their page, you just mail them the old broken lead (or collar), then they'll ship it back to you. I haven't had the luxury of having to return one, their products seem very well made. The added knowledge of where it's made allows you to feel better as all of Lupine products are made in New Hampshire, (USA).
0,Protects our baby's feet from the gravel drive.
0,Nice size for little snacks.  Wish they would also come in an even smaller size for training purposes.
0,As advertised
0,It has its place with the dogs.  They sure like to drink out it.
0,Awesome study..great product!!!!
0,my dog loves this toy, have purchased 2 more for him to have around the house.
0,It's puppy milk.  They eat it.  They like it.  Don't know what else to say.
0,We've been paying $90 per quarter to have the cat groomed (shaved) because it's just not possible to brush him enough to prevent hairballs and as his coat grows, you find dust bunnies everywhere, even right after vacuuming. We decided to make the jump to DIY cat grooming with these clippers after reading the other reviews.		We found:	1) The cat groomers definitely earn their money (which I knew before)	2)  It's a much easier job with 2 people, one to hold the cat and one to run the clippers	3) These clippers work very well on the wispy superfine fur, although I had to keep brushing fur out of the comb blades or else the comb pulled instead of cutting.	4) These clippers don't make a buzz that the cat objects to although he still wasn't very happy with trimming the fanny fur and tail area.	5) The black plastic Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set, which was recommended for purchase with these clippers, doesn't work well at all on wispy cat fur. It either doesn't cut or catches and pulls (which makes for a very unhappy cat). Instead, the blade that comes with the clippers worked much better alone except for the frequent need to brush the fine cat fur out of the teeth (see #3).		These clippers came with a #10 comb leaving the cat's fur at about the length of teddy bear fur. I like that better than shaving down to the skin because it reduces the chances of nicking his skin or irritating the skin by cutting too close. I can't say he liked it, he never does, but that's why the vet told us to give him valium before grooming (talk to your vet before trying it). I think the cat is less bothered because he didn't have to get carsick going to the groomers or get all macho over the other male cats at the groomers.		Now we're through and the fur filled the bathroom trashcan. With one more grooming, we will have made up the cost of the clippers. After that, we'll save $360/year + gas + tip and we don't have to schedule a whole Saturday around it... definitely one of our better purchases.
0,Our pups think you can't go wrong with a Milk-Bone!
0,I bought this for my pup who turned one year old Dec. 2. He loved it! I will buy this again and it didn't bother his stomach at all.
0,Very cute
0,My kitten loves it! She plays with it everyday and all the time. It's her favorite toy.
0,My dog loved it
0,It took a couple of days, but the cats just love this!  And they are starting to look a little less flabby.
0,WOW is this light awesome.  The LED's are so bright my live plants are loving it.  Plus the ability to change the coloring and dim the lighting is great especially for our knifefish that rarely comes out in full light.. we can watch him come out and eat now without straining to find him because we use to shut the tank lights off completely, so thats a great feature for us.		Amazing light, definitely worth the money.
0,I have 3 dogs and got really sick of carrying around three remote controls.  I had to distinguish each remote by a different colored lanyard.  However, in the heat of the moment, if you need to stop your dog from running away, fighting, etc, it was hard to figure out which remote went with which dog.  I no longer have to put a collar on the 3rd dog, and now only having one remote is great.  I love that there is a beep, vibrate, and shock option.  The beep is loud enough to stop one of my dogs in her tracks.  The other dog is a little more stubborn and I've had to switch to the vibration.  I have yet to use the shock feature and would rather not use it.  My dogs have reacted to these very well.  My friend recommended these to me and I would recommend them to anyone else.
0,Used regular BB in the past, but when our dog was found to have food allergies I went to Merrick LID. Merrick recently went up drastically in price so I went to Blue Basics. Dogs are happy, and I am saving money.
0,My kitten loves this and is always playing and sleeping in it. It will be just perfect when she is bigger. Its a nice size. Very sturdy and easy to clean too.
0,Puppy goes crazy for these!  I usually only give her 1/3 of one, they are easy to cut up to help with training. Note: Someone tried to give her the same ones in peanut butter flavor and she wouldn't eat them.
0,My little Snowshoe kitty, Fancy, loves this like no other toy she has.  She carries them around in her mouth, tosses them up, and really wrestles with them which means I pick up a lot of feathers that she pulls out.  I save those in a zip lock bag to make other toys so its not a loss.  But she still loves them even sans feathers.  She plays with these until all the fabric is off and then I finally toss them out when the little seed-like filling starts to come out.  Since it keeps her so occupied and furnishes us with lots of entertainment I keep extras so she gets a new one when the old are tossed out.
0,Darling and a perfect pop of color.
0,My 12 year old lab/rottie mix has been gimping around and miserable for a while.  I tried treats, but she wouldn't touch them!  We started putting this on her food less than a week ago and we can already see a difference!  She's not as uncomfortable as she previously was and likes it outside better (except for the 100+ degree weather!)  I expect to see even more improvement with time and will be back to buy this again!
0,Haven't used it enough to comment on the battery life or durability, but it has worked well for me so far. Plenty big for my dog's massive neck!
0,Great price!
0,I bought these as my Maltese dog has issues with getting groomed by other people. He gets really anxious and freaked out so to calm his nerves (and save a bit of money) I decided to purchase my own clipper set and do it myself. It took me a couple tries to give my dog an semi-even puppy cut but good thing is I seem to get better with each attempt. Still not as good as the professional groomers but I think with a few more times we'll get a system down so that he doesn't move so much and I don't bald him. All in all, these work pretty good. The problems I've had are more operator errors and trying to work around a dog that moves A LOT.
0,I have a cat that goes insane.  We have to heavily sedate him to get him to the vet and then he is insane for 3 days after.	By insane I mean he doesn't recognize anyone (people or sister cat) and is totally in flight or fight mode with a lot of hissing, growling, aggressive behavior, with fur standing on end.  It's a frightening site to behold.  Nothing calms him down but time.  Disrupting the household for 3 days while he gets his act back together is difficult at best (two separate litter boxes, he gets locked in a room, two separate food distributions, etc., long/slow reacclimation to sister cat).		Yesterday, the sister cat let out a meow that apparently startled him and he lost it.  I was afraid he was going to attack me, but after some period of time I managed to get him into a room and close the door.		When I remembered I had bought this for just such an occasion, I put a small amount of shredded cheese in a dish and added the Rescue Remedy.  I slid it into the room quickly and closed the door.  He was still crazy insane hissing and growling.		After 10 minutes I looked in and he was calm.  He knew who I was, his eyes had returned somewhat to normal (they get wildly dilated) and let me pet him.  He was still riled up but not to the same extent.  When he behaved like this in the past, it took 3 days to get him back.		This took 10 minutes.  He was not back to full normal (not that he is ever normal), but he was calmer.  I left him in there for a while.  When I let him out he started hissing at the other cat, so I put him back in the room but I could still get in to pet him.  I put some more of the Remedy in his food and water dishes.  Several hours later, I gave him some more cheese and Remedy.  By dinner time, all was almost back to normal and he wasn't hissing at the other cat.		To me, this is nothing short of a miracle.
0,I have two Shih Tzus who loves these treats. Theyre very tiny, so its perfect for small dogs.
0,My daughter has 2 Guinea Pigs and they love their Cuddle-E-Cups.  I was hesitant to believe that they would literally curl up in their little beds like dogs, but low and behold, they do.  I thought they were a little to big when I first opened the box, but Guinea Pigs actually stretch out when they sleep so Large was just perfect.  They come with clips to attach it to the cage so the piggies don't turn it over.  They are easy to wash and they are so happy when it comes back all clean.  The material is strong, quality product.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking to add comfort to their Guinea Pig's life.  I don't know if I mentioned this, but we bought one for each of the pigs.
0,I take this when we go for walks, to the park and visiting people.  It's perfect to give my dog water and we don't have to dirty someone's bowl at their house.  I've found it opens and closes easily.
0,Great price and my dog loves it.
0,Great for traveling with your small dog or cat, we have two. Just watch out that your cat doesn't learn to open the case and unzip it. We now use a hook to keep her in while we travel.
0,Their filters.  Fluval is awesome
0,he loves it
0,My power chewer has yet to destroy this!
0,Arrived quickly. Tho my birds wouldn't use it. They preferred paper.
0,Works great! I suggest cutting off access to the room until fully dried.
0,Works great the pump is really powerfull
0,My dog usually eats chews and hides within a day. This one he actually made last about two weeks. He loved the inside and immediately took care of that, and the outside part lasted quite awhile before I started finding little pieces everywhere. Good price for my intended buy!
0,1st I read all of the direction. They say to make sure you wash your hands after handling, because the collar has a lot of chemicals that can be harmful. My cat was infested with FLEAS, he had bumps all over his body. I was told he had an allergy. After I put the collar on his skin started to clear up. The collar works really well. We only had.one problem. Since.my cat did have a rash the collar irritated my cat rashes. The rash around his neck turned into sores. I decided to take the collar off until rash and sores around his neck heal. So make sure your cat does not have a rash or open sores near the neck.
0,My dogs immediately started using this product.  I leave my dogs on my deck when I'm away, so I needed something to contain their waste.  This works flawlessly, it's easy to clean, and isn't an eyesore.  It's also cheaper than similar alternatives.
0,Bought for my moms Yorkie who destroys every toy bought for him. I am impressed. He has not been able to destroy this one and he definitely has tried. This is one of his favorite toys now and ours too seeing as we didn't waste our money for a change. All of his other toys only lasted a day but this one is still in tact. Kudos to West Paw Design!
0,Makes life simpler on long walks when I want to carry rewards.  Holds my cell phone.  I can walk 2 dogs easily.
0,Easy and comfortable to use.  Cuts clean and controllable when trying to maneuver around.
0,Puppy loves it.  I can finally get some work done without having him in my arms.  He's a 10 pound Maltipoo.  The large fit him with a bit of room to grow. Great quality.  Had previously bought one of those slings. He jumped out of that.
0,Works well I have 3 cats so use a lot. they have a good capacity.
0,Excellent quality
0,My dog loves them.
0,Purchased these for our 13 year old who is having hip problems, making it difficult for her to walk on slick surfaces like tile and hardwood. Based on the recommendation from their web site, we purchased size small for our 28 lb terrier. The socks were a little difficult to put on, but having two people really helps.		While they stayed on, they seemed to work pretty well. Unfortunately, within a day the socks would be found around the house and our poor dog would be slipping around, again. We don't know if she was taking them off or if they were just coming off on their own, but the socks needed to be put back on almost every day.		If it were easier to put on and stayed on better, it would be a five star product.
0,Just what I expected, Fast shipping and great price.
0,It's hard to put the door on...but other than that I like it! I don't love it but I think my kitten likes it.
0,Great design, my only complaint is that for a "large" bowl, it is very small! I have to refill it almost daily with water for my small dog and cat.
0,Love this leash. I must admit it is a little large for my miniature poodle but my husband likes the fit and finish. He claims, it is the best leash I have ever purchased.
0,My dogs love then
0,My dog loves this mat.  He would always lay on the small tile area when he got hot, but now he lays on his mat.  I bought the large for around the house and a medium for his crate and car rides. It is not extremely cold, but it is enough to cool him off and cooler than the tile.  I really like that it doesn't have to be filled with water which could leak out and it recharges itself without having to put in the refrigerator or freezer.	  I just wish there was a size between the medium and large.
0,Excellent quality and very nice looking.
0,works great
0,My 2 pitbulls love these. Everytime we come back from a walk they walk right to where i keep the treats and sit down and wait for me.... They don't do that for milkbones..
0,Dog loves it.
0,I have a 21lb mini goldendoodle pup who just turned 1yr old this week.  Previous to finding S&C, I spend tons of money on 5 star Kibble, Wet Food, and Raw Diets. My pup had such a sensitive stomach and had constant loose stools.  As a result, he was underweight and it was truly frustrating seeing him ignore his food.  It has been about 4 months since our pup has been eating S&C.  He is now a healthy weight, his stool is perfect, and it is amazing to see him finally eat all of his food.  We boil a little bit of water and mix it in with his patties and he devours them.  He will even look at me and ask me for more; something that never happened before!!  HIs absolute favorites are Duck and Pheasant. Thank you S&C. We are no longer throwing away bags of expensive kibble.
0,I have searched for a small pellet, grain free food.  This one meets those criteria, and the cats like it.  It is a bit expensive, thus the 4star rating.
0,My dog's love it and I love the price and convenience.  Always arrives on time.
0,Bought this toy for my Golden when he was 7 months old, it was a lot of fun for him while it lasted, maybe one month.
0,This dog food seems like a great quality food, smells nice and my dog loved it! I tried it because she has terrible gas and skin allergies, specifically sensitive to grass and possibly certain dog food ingredients. She has been on lamb and rice formulas for years, as suggested by her vet, and the brand I have fed for years recently changed its formula and ruined a good thing. She hates the taste, had gigantic loose and frequent poops even after finishing a 37 lb bag, and so that was the end of that. So I started looking for an alternative, wondering if maybe the meat is the issue. Plus she is tired of eating lamb. She loved the flavor of this Iams food, but unfortunately her gas problem was worse on this formula than lamb and rice, and her skin allergies did not improve, so the search continues. We both liked the food, and if your dog can eat chicken, I would highly recommend you try it! Not to be gross, but her stools were compact and the appropriate consistency, which is an indicator of a high quality and easily digestible dog food.
0,Had to get a new one when the old one broke so i bought the same one again because it's an  easy set up and removal also its easy to clean.
0,This is perfect for my Kitty and easy to use.
0,Love it! Fit my son's little dog.
0,Pretty!
0,only problem is that my dogs legs are too long.
0,I've purchased 2 of these since my dog was a puppy (she's 10 now).  Soft, durable and can toss it in the washing machine.  It doesn't restrict my dogs movement when she runs, a great design and it's very soft, lightweight and adjustable. It will last a long time! Great product.
0,I have now tried three different Eukanuba recipes this week and this one's the best.  This one actually has healthy ingredients in it and no corn, which gives many dogs the squirts.  I have learned after sampling the Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy and Weight Maintenance recipes, that the quality of Eukanuba's kibble is as diverse as there are dog breeds on this planet.  I've learned to pay attention to ingredients.  The ingredients for this recipe are listed here on Amazon.  Interestingly, the recipes for the Large Breed Puppy and Weight Maintenance, both which contain corn meal as #1 and #2 ingredients respectively, are NOT listed on the company's Amazon pages.  I wonder why that is?		The kibble here is smaller than a US Dime and of a medium shade of brown.  My dogs are liking this formula.  This formula is definitely one of the company's better formulas.
0,Our dog love this bone.  Nothing more needs to be said.
0,I went to this food instead of the Fancy Feast brand just because its primary ingredient is chicken.  Nice and chunky.
0,I like it but my dog didn't.  It's cute and exactly as pictured.  The only downside was when I washed the inner pad the foam got all twisted up and the only way to fix it is to cut it open and straighten it out.  I had to wash it because my dog doesn't like the bed and he pees on it.
0,Awesome product. I used this product for my rottweilers over the years. Excellent for there bones and teeth. There skull sizes and bones are huge and they're very healthy. This is a great calcium source
0,Use it for three of my dogs ranging from 70 to 40 lbs to get into my truck without the ramp my back was hurting to lift them into the back of the truck bed. Easy to handle and worth the price easier on my back.
0,I purchased the water lettuce for my turtle tank.  They do the job, and the turtle likes hanging on them, so I can't really complain.  But, they were much smaller than I expected (about 2.5 inches across) and they tend to lean/tip instead of floating flat.  Also, I'd like to be able to link multiple of these together.  This package is a good size for a 25-35 gallon tank.
0,Great idea, and it does keep the water cold.  Just not sure it works any better than placing a regular bowl in the freezer.
0,Like this harness better than other ones I have seen.  Quality is good for the price!
0,My cat loves these and she's pretty pick about what she eats.  So far she's still eating them and it's been 2 weeks.
0,It finally came today and I absolutely LOVE it!!!! It's so cute & very well made. I took so many pictures as soon as I put it on her. All I have to do is fluff out the skirt & it'll be great. The price is also great for the quality of it.		I'm glad I read the reviews before I got it though because had I gotten her the size I normally would, it would have been tiny. I have a 7 or 8 pound pomeranian so I usually get smalls & depending on the item extra smalls. This medium fits her perfectly! It's long enough and also has some stretch to it. So take the advice of everyone else and order a size or two up.		The only con I had is with the shipping. It took almost a month to receive it, which is understandable since it's coming all the way from China. Although, it did come a lot sooner than expected & predicted by the site. I was also unable to track the shipping progress which made me nervous because it's so unpredictable.		So if you're looking to order something cute for a special occasion make sure you do it a month or more in advance.		I'm going to order more!!!!
0,Perfect size toy for a 12 lb. dog.  He likes having so many squeakers!
0,Great seat for a good price. I have looked at them in the pet stores and they are way more expensive. My dog loves this because it sits up higher and he can still see out the windows.
0,Our dog has allergies and was on one of those $$$$$ hypo-allergenic diets... the Vet suggested this brand as a good balance of food value and our schnauzer really loves it.  He keeps a good weight, and never seems to get tired of it.... so we're happy and so is the Vet!
0,I have a beagle and she will not allow me to brush her teeth. I give her one of these every other day and she loves them. They really do get those teeth way in the back.
0,Can't even tell there is a cat in the house.
0,This is a very solid and reputable pinch collar.		I use mine on my 90 pound Rottie girl to maintain full control.		It has lasted over a year with little wear and tear.  Keeps the nice shine also.
0,Doggie crack.  That's what this is!
0,Have one cat that this is only dry she'll eat. Been buying this for 7 yrs now, good thing bag is resealable now. Usually buy on Chewy but since was getting other things here, why not. Prob will delete off Chewy.
0,This is another one of those hard to find products in stores.  I took a chance that Amazon might sell this treat as my dogs love the flavor.  I've tried other flavors but my dogs only like this particular one.  I use it as a treat when they first get up in the morning.
0,I mix 2 tablespoons of this into 1 pound of raw food. You have to do a tiny bit of math to figure out how much to use for the amount you're mixing. The cats love it. I feel like it's made the fur of one of the cats softer. I've only been using this for the past month, so hopefully I'll notice more good effects as time goes on. Just remember to put this away once you're done mixing it into the food. The bag is easily torn up by bad kitties looking for a tasty midnight snack. On the plus side, despite having gotten into the supplement, it didn't cause my cats any harm. I was worried about some kind of overdose on vitamins, but there was absolutely no negative effects from eating too much of this.
0,If you want a shiny coat and supple fur on your dog this is it.  You will notice a difference within a week. And there are no side effects for my GSD or Sheltie (no diarrhea, vomiting, etc.).  They will be on this for life!  The skin is pink and perfect, no scratching or biting and the fur feels like it's been conditioned (not greasy just shiny and beautiful).  You and your pet will love this product!
0,Of the 3 petcams/treat dispensers I have tried, this is the best. The app is very responsive in telling you just when your dog is barking. I can have a conversation next to the device and it won't go off. One bark from one of my dogs in proximity and I get a ping on my cell phone. The camera has excellent resolution and the treat flinging mechanism is perfect. Other devices make a lot of whirring and violent clicking when throwing a treat. The Furbo does not. My dogs wait for the treats to be tossed out instead of going nuts and dodging a big handful of treats. Furbo throws just enough (a few pieces of kibble sized treats) and does it without a big commotion. If my dogs are acting up and I'm away, I can go from barking to laying down after a snack in less than 20 seconds. It has a two way microphone and the ability to share pictures and videos. I found the setup very easy as well.
0,Like magic for my busy pup. Our walks have become so much more enjoyable for us both.  We've made such progress with no negative consequences for my pup. He just "got it".  Highly recommended
0,Overall a good travel crate, the XL fit my smaller GSD perfectly. This is not for the extreme digger or crazy dog. The zipper is a little flimsy, but easy set up and take down!
0,Love this little launcher! If your dogs are anything like mine they will play fetch for hours on end and their ball gets disgusting! This thing is great because you will never have to touch that slobbery ball again and it can launch really far.
0,Good quality calming coat.  It took a little for Doggie to get used to wearing it but she's fine with it now.  I followed suggestions on the enclosed Instruction Card and they helped.
0,I ordered 3 West Paw dog toys for my 80 lb Mastiff mix puppy. I got a Jive Large Dog toy, A large hurley dog toy, and this tux dog toy. This is his favorite! I was worried the 'compartment' for hiding treats would get ruined. Surprisingly, that is not the case. True to title, this toy is tough. The shape is also very appealing to my dog and makes him use his paws to flip it over and such. The bounce this toy has makes for a fun time. I've found that a normal sized Beggin strip folded in the compartment gave my dog an hour of fun one night. He LOVES this toy! I plan on getting more West Paw toys because the price is well worth it.
0,The dogs love them.
0,my turtle is spoiled and loves these shrimps! She even looks happy eating them, and won't eat other turtle foods but loves lettuces.
0,These are awesome! I ordered 2 for my dogs. They shipped quickly, there labeled on both sides & the colors are clear & bright! All the shapes & colors to choose from is awesome. Definitely ordering again thank you!
0,great product
0,I love this stuff....everything dies....it's good....I use it always....
0,Came nice and sharp, perfect addition to my collection.
0,My dogs love this. I mix it with Science Diet and they gobble it down.
0,I was hesitant to order this Cat "Condo"/"tree". However, I'm really glad I did for the following reasons:		(1) I have two kittens (2 months old) that absolutely love it. They sleep on it; wrestle on it; watch birds out the window on it; and enjoy it constantly.		(2) It's easy to put together. It comes boxed and has the screws and tools supplied to put together. I'm NOT a handyman and it took me about 15 minutes. It was painless and easy.		(3) The cats also use it to scratch on and so far it appears pretty durable.		I highly recommend this product for your cat/cats!
0,Using this on a stray kitten that had very dirty itchy ears. Ive used it 3 times every 3rd days
0,Wonderful on the stand, mediocre on the floor. The door doesn't close very tight. If you want to use the ball on the floor, tape it shut. We had a ball before this and use this only on the stand. Ziva like it, so that's all that matters.
0,This is a classy dog collar! It has some really nice touches that make it stand out from some other brands that Ive used.		The color combinations offered for this are really pleasant, I chose the olive and blue/gray option, and think it is represented well in the photos.		One cool thing about this collar is the d-rings that are on both sides of the buckle. Sometimes I worry that plastic buckles will not hold up over time, or will crack under too much stress or pressure. But since a leash can attach to both rings which pull over the buckle from each side, a dog pulling on the leash will never put stress on the buckle itself  only on the fabric of the color.		The color has great reflective stitching running through it (made by 3M). Also included is a separate little spot to hang their identification tags from, so that you don't have to attach it to the same spot as the leash attach point.		I purchased the medium size for my 60 pound dog. She has a neck size of 15 inches, and I was initially worried that this collar would not fit her at its smallest adjustment, since it says it goes down to 14.5 inches. It was simple to adjust, however, and I even had to make it larger, so there is plenty of room to adjust it.		I normally buy collars with metal clasps so I don't have to worry about them breaking over time, but the unique D Ring setup for attaching to leashes really makes this collar stand out. This collar is practical, attractive, and affordable and I will be recommending this company to my friends when they are looking for quality pet accessories.		Note: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. These are my unbiased opinions and I haven't been compensated in any way.
0,Thank you
0,My fish LOVE these flakes. My betta has started refusing his pellets (also New Life Spectrum) to eat these. Which I figure with such good quality will be fine. my ONLY complaint is how large the flakes are...BUT I imagine for larger fish this size is perfect. but for my guppies and tetras they are a bit big but I just crumple them up a bit. Also the container is HUGE!! Way more than i expected. So its expensive but will last my small tanks probably a year if not more!
0,Looks just like the picture, I really like the pink accent line, but feels stiff and thin - uncomfortable to hold. So far it has held up well, and I'm hoping it will soften with use.
0,Works perfect for catching the water my dog spills over the side of the bowl. For some reason he is incapable of not splashing it everywhere when he drinks. The little lip around the outside does just prefect for containing the mess.
0,These collars have a nice cushion to them! They are really nicely made and fit perfect on my large lab mixes. I gave them a good tug (not while on my dog) to simulate him pulling and the buckle held firm. I love that's there's a small loop to put tags on as its so much easier than getting them in the large metal ring! Great buy!
0,All our dogs like it.
0,If the cats could figure how to order this stuff and then open it, we'd be in trouble.  They really do love it.  Good to find it in full cases.
0,We absolutely loved this harness and was extremely disappointed that we had to return it.  It was just too big for our pup.  Not a problem I thought, I'll just order the "small".  This time however I did more research and was disappointed...once again...that the small appears to be too...well...small.  Our pup has a 10" inch neck and a 17-1/2" chest girth.  If the sizing will work for your dog, then I highly recommend this product.  It is attractive, its breathable, and if your pup sees a rabbit...that you don't see until it is too late... that he just has to catch, he won't harm himself when he makes that totally unexpected power leap.
0,This is excellent food, much better than premium dry food sold by veterinarians. I have two dogs of intestinal problems & this food is so wonderful. I even go to the expense of having it shipped all the way to Costa Rica, and paying customs duty plus shipping
0,no problem...just like from the store!  kitty likes it!
0,Used it this weekend, my little Maltese loved it! Looked very good too!
0,Much--much better than the cheaper alternatives. Don't do what I did: go through all the lesser models first. Go right to this one.
0,My puppy loves these.
0,Very durable, engraved on both sides and so cute!  Will be ordering more!!!
0,This product has been working for over two years now without any glitches. My neighbors spend over $50 every 6 weeks for dog grooming and this product paid for itself after one cut. No issues to report and easy to use!
0,Absolutely love these pads. I purchased 3 sizes for my 3 different crates. Terrific quality
0,Made a wonderful knife grip and my chihuahua loved the cut off.
0,outsmarted my dog!
0,This is a life saver for your furniture and the cat! I won't declaw another cat. Out lastest adoptee loves this scratcher. I just bought her the third one in two years. They last about a year but are well worth the cost. You can spray a little catnip on it at first for an introduction. This is the best cat product around.
0,My two kitties love these treats and meow for them all day long. I do not think I have seen a reduction in the amount of hair balls being coughed up, but it is okay since they really like these treats.
0,My short-hair pit/lab has very sensitive skin.  This does not cause irritation and leaves him nice and clean after a bath.  The smell is not that great, and he ends up just smelling like a wet dog...but I guess that is ok :)
0,great stuff, Dog likes it, have been using liquid for a year now and 11 year old Aussie is doing great!
0,Holding up well
0,I purchased quite some time ago and this leash has many many washings on it. It is a well-made leash that will last forever.
0,These are great but my fault as they are a WEE BIT TINY.  my dogs are both 90# so they look silly with these small tags.
0,My wife loves it, makes our jobs much easier.  Only downside is one dog will sometimes pull the other while he is trying to poop.
0,Good toy to exercise the kitties.  One of my cats is scared of my similar fluttering feather toy, but he loves this.  (I think he had a bad experience with a predatory bird.
0,I wish all pet owners would purchase and use them.  The holder makes it easy to attach it to your leash and always have them handy.
0,This one is adorable and for the youngest of the three and whose name just happens to be PRINCESS
0,Purchased the bags for a nephew with 2 aquariums to hold filter mediums. The bags seem to be well constructed of a nylon mesh, with a plastic or nylon zipper and zipper tab. The mesh openings are too wide to hold any medium that has the consistency of grains of sand. He uses them to hold lava rock and polyester fill and seems to be happy with them.
0,fits perfectly in my new Equinox!  Keeps all that dog hair on the cover instead of flying around the car too.  Now instead of wanting to come up front, my dog stays in the back and lays down on the cover.  It's very soft and stays in place.  Shakes off beautifully.
0,A terrific collar. It is sturdy and fits perfectly on my French Bull Dogs neck. She also loves the color red.
0,My favorite thing about this collar is that it's quite sturdy. We have a dog who insists on destroying every collar we put on him, and with this one, he has met his match. He's had it over 3 months, and it's still in one piece- and not any worse for the wear! I especially like that it has a separate loop for the tags to go on (plastic, and separate from the D rings you would hook a leash to), because he hasn't lost his tags yet either! Definitely a great collar for a dog who just needs a sturdy, basic collar.
0,I got this for my mice because i needed more tubes and this was the perfect amount, and at a great price
0,Great quality! Very pretty only Yorkie. Get a ton of compliments.
0,Crunchy, like a hard cracker, so it satisfies our old dogs need to chew.  They must be tasty because he stands there staring at me for more once the treat is devoured!
0,I do weekly water changes on my Aquarium as part of my maintenance, like many other fish keepers. Since I only have a 6 gallon tank (Fluval Edge) this mini siphon is perfectly sized for skimming the substrate and of course extracting the dirty water.		The method of starting the suction is a little tricky, and something that I don't always get right. Trying to bob the suction head in the water can disturb your decorations, plants, and freak your fish out so I in turn purchased a primer bulb to get the suction flowing and then remove it once it has started. It's a little extra hassle at first but at this point it's so much preferred. There's one thing that I refuse to do, like some do, and that is to get the suction going initially by using your mouth.		Just remember that the tube has to be pointing down in your bucket and has to be lower than where your tank is for your best chance of getting suction to start. Quality of the tubing is nice and the bucket lip attachment for the hose is an awesome addition.		If you're curious about adding the primer pump search Ebay for "NEW TYPE Fuel Pump Hand Primer Bulb All Fuels 8 mm Length 150MM 9001080A" It does come from China so it'll take a while but really good quality and cheap. I just stick it to the bottom of the hose, pump it to get started, and then remove it for unrestricted water flow. Alternatively you could cut your hose in the middle and insert the pump that way.
0,I feel good about using these because I know they will disintegrate relatively quickly and not pollute the environment.  They don't break at the bottom like another brand I tried.  Also they smell nice at least until used.
0,I have two goldens, goldens are notorious for hip and joint problems. The veterinarian I work for recommends that goldens be started on glucosamine and chondroitin after one year of age. My older 7 year old golden has tried many different brands, the often have a strange smell and give her awful gas. This brand smells like beef bullion and booth dogs happy do tricks for this "treat". Price wise this is less expense than the vet brand they sell at work and has similar concentrations, I would definitely purchase this again		I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review.
0,cats play with them but not that often but they are good
0,I guess I should have payed attention to the large bird in the picture.  It was way too big for my parakeet, but it is sturdy and very colorful and if she was bigger Im sure she would love to play with it.
0,the dog love there toys
0,I like the design and I hope I'll like the larger versions when they arrive.  The one I bought here did not come close to fitting so I ordered several larger versions to expedite finding the right size.  This is only possible for me because I live close enough to an Amazon locker that allows for free returns.		My complaint is that the information for ordering the correct size is really poor on most Muttluks items.  I went to their official web site and read to measure my dog from the base of the neck to the tail and order the corresponding size.  I did and what I received was woefully small.  I'm guessing it was at least two to three sizes to small.  I wish there was information here or on the Muttluks site that would offer advice on girth measurements and not just length.  Dogs come in all sizes and Muttluks isn't giving us much to go on.  I bet literally hundreds of these have been returned to Amazon for being the wrong size.  So much of that might be avoided if only better sizing information was available.
0,Does a great job of aerating tank. Highly. recommend. Fish love floating thru the bubbles.
0,Our house is truly a "multi cat" household.  Over the years we have purchased several pet fountains.  This one will be the fourth fountain.  Our home has two stories & we have a fountain on both.  I have the pleasure of cleaning & maintaining them.  I have always had to take them apart & clean them @ least once a week.  I have always had to replace the filters each week as well.  This process is tedious, time consuming & costly.  Despite those drawbacks I would never go back to using a standard water dish.  It's quite true that the pet fountains encourage cats & dogs to drink more water.  My cats love having them available.  I am thrilled with this particular model.  It is MUCH easier to disassemble, & clean.  It literally takes less then half the time I usually spend with previous models.  Additionally the filters are of a better quality & require only a quick weekly rinse.  The filters need to be replaced after 3-4 weeks as opposed to weekly.  I will be purchasing a second Drinkwell fountain whenever I need to replace the existing fountain on the other floor.
0,Works good dog is a Lil squirmy at times but cuts back on the grooming bill and making me think twice about what profession im in lol thick sturdy and love the guard to protect so I don't get to close
0,A little small for a cockatiel and would not recommend. perfect for smaller birds.
0,My little guys love this and they are REALLY picky. I have tried others but they seem to like these the best.
0,awesome for the cats to get the hydration they so desperately need, especially if they have a mostly dry food diet ... and if you have cats that only eat the gravy out of wet food they'll really like this too
0,It is only for 1 toy, but it is exactly as pictured and my dog is obsessed with these toys!
0,No more 0300 am wakeup knocks , from my cats.  The SSScat sits outside my door and they stay away.
0,My dog loves it. A little smelly but tolerable.
0,You must get this with the ultimate cat post. Well made. Great price, color and product.
0,My dogs love this. The bed is really soft and cozy. The fabric at the bottom is a little thin. It would not stop me from buying it again unless it falls apart right away and I don't think it will. It's a great price and the top stays up.
0,Good light. Keeps my dragons warm.
0,Really well made leash. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I wish the clip was smaller. I ordered a small leash and the clip is a little big and heavy for my small dog.
0,Nice, thank you!
0,I must have read a million reviews trying to figure out what basking platform to get for my baby turtles - and this platform is the BEST!  It is very easy to assemble and it has suction cups at the bottom of each post.  The platform will adjust with the water level.  My little guys love to just hold on the the ramp during the day and swim under the platform all the time.  They have no problem getting onto the platform for basking.  When I first read the reviews... I was afraid that this thing was going to fill up my 40 gallon tank - but it barely uses up one corner.  And like I said, they love to play underneath the platform - it was an excellent investment!!
0,My dogs love these things.  Great price from Amazon, so I stocked up.
0,High quality. Padded and smooth on the inside of the collar so as not to irritate your pet's neck. When buying a pet collar, emember to think about not only the length but also the width as that affects your pet's comfort and safety.
0,Soft, cuddly without being too big for the crate! Pup had a tiny accident, threw it in the washer and dryer and it came out good as new! Cannot go wrong with this, comes in many sizes and is reasonably priced! Very happy:)
0,I use this on my cats and am free from flees and the price is wonderful.
0,these treats are greats as they are real food held together by a little honey. Hamster and gerbils both like them and are good for thier teeth wish they came in bigger bags though
0,My cat love these treats; I don't feed them too often because of the rosemary, but that just means they enjoy them more when they get them. Actually, my cats love all the various brands of lysine treats so I buy them all.
0,Fits the giant dog crate well.  Not hard to install.
0,When the platypus arrived, none of us fully understood it.  I didn't get why a dog would enjoy removing squeaky toys from a stuffed cavity.  This was her first plush  toy and I imagined her shredding the platypus and possibly eating the eggs.  For about a month, my dog didn't remove any eggs, but she loved the platypus and gently carried it around, squeaking its belly.  Then, after about a three-week incubation period, the platypus patient received a slight C-section and my dog extracted the eggs.		She still loves her platypus. She loves digging the eggs out and carying them proudly around the house.  This dog is not a strong chewer and the platypus and her offspring have held up pretty well over the months, with mild wear, like the aforementioned C-section and some tears to the eggs.  The eggs are also fun to put in other toys like her hollow rubber lattice ball. Dogs just like pulling stuff out of stuff, apparently. We recently got the Hide-a-Squirrel and she loves that, too.		Great toy!
0,My bird loves this. We have had this for almost a year and my concure loves to go in and look at the world. Very well made. Made to last.
0,pups love these
0,Thank you very much, fast shipping, & good price
0,High quality product.  I love the plexiglass spashguard, especially with my open-top tank.  I have a fully-planted high-tech 75 gal setup, and while my plants are growing and happy, they aren't pearling.  If you just dose Flourish Excel or don't have many plants, this would work great for you.  If you inject carbon and have a lot of plants competing for light, either buy 2 of this product or go with T5 HO light setup with 3 or 4 bulbs.
0,When our dog graduated from a non-pulling harness, we got this model.  Although it does not provide the control and the non-pulling harness, it catches less fur from her Winter coat.
0,I keep this in my dogs crate at night because she kept dumping over her regular bowl and soaking her bed. I haven't had any accidents at all since this purchase. I Love this bowl. Just enough water and easy to clean and fill.
0,My cat loves these little mice. The feathers have survived a couple of weeks of play thus far. My only complaint is that the product is manufactured in China, and they have some questionable regulations regarding fur. Obviously, this is of no concern to my cat as to whether he is possibly playing with the remains of his cat brethren, but I personally might not have purchased them had I known this.
0,its good
0,My dogs love them. Glad they're getting whatever might be missing from their food.
0,The size is big enough to keep six cats fed for a week or more, as a supplement to their canned food.  It is easy to fill and clean, and I love the simple, squared design.
0,Really works!  We have spent 100s of dollars on grooming supplies for our dog and this is the first one that actually prevents knots.  Scent is ok and little string at first but eventually fades in 1-2 days.  Would buy again.
0,he looks forward to this food. the weird rash on his chin and lips is gone.
0,I have one cat that doesn't really play alone. He loves to play with string and wrestle with his brother, but he doesn't play with any of the stuffed mice or various toys strewn about the house. He LOVES this toy, and guards if from his brother on the rare occasion they both want it. It's fun to watch him toss it in the air and then chase after it. I'm on the second toy, and it's well worth the money. The first one would have lasted longer but they've hidden it, I'm assuming it's with the other missing toys and all my hair ties.
0,My 13 year old chow/shepherd mix takes meds for his arthritis/spine degeneration, and he spits out pills if they aren't hidden in food/treats. These work great, they don't upset his very-sensitive stomach, but wow do they smell awful!!! That's the only drawback -- I literally have to breathe through my mouth when giving Kiwi his meds twice a day... but it's a small price to pay.  I just make sure I wash my hands thoroughly after handling these to get the odor off my skin!
0,Really cute, well made cat bowls. My 2 cats loved it right  away.
0,great value
0,great
0,My little girl loves this ball. It is great for little dogs because the can play ball just like the big dogs. She is able to bite into it to throw it.
0,my dogs liked it
0,It just works!
0,The five stars mean "I love it"; however, in this case my Collie loves it!  She chews through a lot but in this case it has stood up for weeks and we play with it together daily.
0,Wow is all I can say right now. I have purchased strollers for my dogs in the past varying from $100 - $200 and I must say that this stroller at $114.00 delivered is by far the best. I have TWO Pomeranian-Papillon's (Paperanian's) 8lbs each and they fit perfectly together. The NO-ZIP feature is the only way to go. The back of the stroller is screened for FULL VIEW of your dogs as you stroll. The under-carriage is large enough for anything you will need from your purse to a dog bag. It is simply a wonderful purchase. Makes me sick to my stomach that a paid $200 for another stroller in the past that doesn't even measure up to what I have now. Good job Pet Gear on this gem of a stroller. My dogs are riding in style and loving every minute.
0,Love it
0,good quality. my oscar chilid fishes love it
0,my cat needed this so bad she is getting old works out perfectly good constructed item easy to put together
0,Very good product
0,Perfect fit.
0,Can confirm this product works as it should.  I didn't rinse out the bag of sand I bought good enough and it really clouded my tank.  Ordered this and put it in at 4pm right after the UPS lady dropped it off, and by the next morning tank was crystal clear.
0,This is ok, but not the best for my Great Pyre, but works ok for the lab.
0,I love this
0,This is a must have for grooming your dog. It holds my bichon in place so I can complete her grooming in one sitting. This kept her from sitting and trying to give me her belly while grooming. This cut grooming time by at least half.
0,Love this door just needed replacement and was very quick getting it!!
0,It's light and it's not leather so it's washable.
0,Our dog really enjoys these treats. Healthy for her as well. Made in the USA!
0,This is fabulous, not breathable fabric, but plenty of ways to let air in. Looks way better than the blanket we had over the crate before, and super easy to clean.
0,Very pleased
0,I like it. It is pretty on my dog. I've to order one size larger for my dog. She weights 12lbs.
0,My dogs love everything from pet cuisine.
0,Worked perfectly. Went on a Southwest airlines flight from Houston to Cambridge with two cats in tow, both in their separate Sherpa carriers. They fit well under the seats, but note that one end is more flexible than the other due to some kind of hard frame built into one of the sides (so shove the flexible side in first). One cat meowed for about 20 minutes initially during the taxi ride to the airport, but eventually settled down. They also meowed during take-off but that's understandable, and doesn't reflect poorly on the carrier.		Warning: The velcro that secures the liner to the board on the bottom sticks really strongly to any cat collars/harnesses that are somewhat frayed. One of my cats lifted the liner off and got her collar stuck, making it very snug on her and restricting her movement. I didn't notice until I got home, but thankfully she was not injured.
0,These are good for wiping off my dogs face and clearing the gunk from her eyes. Good for wiping her feet off after a hike. The seal seems to be keeping the remaining wipes moist.
0,Cats love it.  A little pricey and slow delivery coming from Japan, but made for a great Christmas gift.
0,I gave this dog food 5 stars because it is very good food and I have been feeding it for a long time. I also use Wellness canned food and cat food, wet and dry. I am writing this review because I am appalled at the increase in price. It has gone up approx. $15.00 within the last 2 months. I will definitely look for a better price elsewhere.	OK.....I give up. It seems that the price has gone up everywhere else too. So my only choice is to pay more 'cause I'm not going to change my dog food. It's one of the best dog foods available and that's what my pets deserve!!!
0,I have tried 3 different trimmers and this is the best one I have tried. I have two very large dogs and wood floors, this is the only way to keep my floors safe. When cutting their nails I was always afraid of getting too close to the quik so I wouldn't cut them as close as they needed. this elimates that worry.
0,I am a novice saltwater aquarist. Product is easy to use and  great product. Amazon with very good services also
0,The size of these bully sticks are great for our Doberman. I don't have to worry about little pieces breaking off, and she loves running around with them like she found a stick in the back yard. I have to say they definitely stink when you open the bag, nearly took my breath away. Our puppy loves them though and that's all that matters.
0,Awesome immune building supplement!
0,Fun toy
0,I have tried every other poop bag there is and this is the only one with the best price, best quality, and best all around. Many of the other bags don't tear right and are so thin you can smell the waste on your hand. Great value and Best Buy.
0,Great Dog food, the best my boxer dog JJ loves it... ... more so you need to look at the ingredients amazing.
0,Well pleased with this! Love all their products!
0,Had to throw away the Frontline. Guess they say fleas getting immune to it or something. Advantage II is fantastic so far! Have 3 cats and not one flea in sight on any of them after checking two days later. Hope this stuff works forever because I get concerned about putting stronger meds on them cause the old stuff don't work anymore. Better values on Amazon compared to pet store or all other department stores.
0,My tough chewers love these!!! All the Benebones. They must be delicious because both my dogs try to steal from eachother,...but there are the exact same!!! Love those dogs!!! Much safer then rawhide and clearly taste great. A great chew treat for your dog that will last, but take away when large 'chips' start breaking off.
0,My dog is a shih tzu , weighs 13 pounds and is perfect.
0,Made more room for my dog food and I am so in to organizing it satisfies me!!!
0,I LIKE I DONT HAVE TO CARRY IT....BUT MY BABIES LIKE THE TASTE
0,Works as expected.
0,Love the color, but it wasn't as L as I'd hoped. I took measurements, of my 10 month old English Mastiff mix puppy, and I ordered a L, accordingly, and was disappointed it didn't fit as expected. I also ordered an XL in orange and that size is slightly big, but she'll grow into it. I was hoping the purple would fit...
0,I have found the JW pet Company's GripSoft Cat Nail Clipper to be very easy to use. I had tried a guillotine style clipper before and did not like it as much. I find that this one makes a nice, clean cut and is easy to use despite my cat's tendency to squirm.
0,My puppy is so high energy we play frisbee during the day and at night glow ball he adores it. Very durable. he is a aggressive chewer and has been holding up looks new even though he chews on it and carries it around.
0,This stuff gives my pup SO much energy! He already has a lot of energy, but I am only giving this to him every couple of days now because his energy soars even more when he takes this.  He loves it, and takes it with no issue at all.
0,This was an excellent purchase.  My tall dog instantly used it to eat and drink.  In fact, drinking water from the stand seemed at first to be one of his favorite pastimes.  I almost wonder if he was really in some discomfort before the elevated stand arrived.  I love its beauty and how sturdy it seems.  Thank you, PetFusion!
0,Really good kitten food, highly recommend it.
0,I am an avid runner and purchased this item for runs, walks, and hikes with my boxer dog.  This item is very sturdy and well made.  The clips are heavy.		Currently, dog is only 4 months old, and the first time of use required a little learning curve both for me and him since he was used to responding to a regular leash.  A few times he got ahead of me on a single track hike and looked back to make sure I was still there since he didn't feel any tension from the leash.  Both of us got used to it.  Very handy for hikes.  The belt was comfortable and didn't chafe me or cause my shirt fabric to pill.		This morning was my first run using this.  It worked very well, but I took a star off because the belt was noisy.  With every foot strike, the metal clip would bang against the clip on the belt.  I don't run with music and I dislike repetitive noises like this (looking at you, people who run marathons with sport beans rattling around in your pockets), and I don't wish to disturb others if they are also bothered by this type of noise.  I believe there could be an improvement in the connection between leash and belt that would hopefully reduce or eliminate this problem.  I'm going to try to cover it with fabric or tape and see if that helps, since I love all the other features of the leash.  Otherwise, I'm very happy with my purchase and boxer pup seems to be happy as well!		EDIT December 2016: This leash is holding up amazingly well.  The dog, now 6+ months and >50 lbs., likes to carry it in his mouth during the runs and sometimes tugs with it.  No quality issues at all.  He has learned to know which direction I plan to turn if I move the leash that direction just prior to the turn.  To remedy the noise situation, I wrapped the D-ring on the belt in medical tape.  I forgot to bring this leash with me on a trip and went running with him on a traditional leash and he about tore off my shoulder.  Never again!  Buy this leash!
0,This is a nice carrier for small dog or cat. I like that there's a mesh on the top, side, and the opening so it's breathable. It is taller than the carrier I currently have which gave my dog room to sit up and turn around. This fits my silky terrier perfectly. However, the size Large is a little smaller than the size large carrier that you see at local pet store. The shoulder strap is adjustable but I wish it would have more padding since I'm carrying a 15lbs dogs. The top mesh section can be push down when you're putting it under the seat. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
0,Easy to put together, sturdy and not unattractive. Our puppy loves this crate. We have a typical wire crate in the den, which she likes and spends a lot of time in it because we spend a lot of time in the den, but, when she disappears I can usually find her, and her fave toy du jour, lying quietly in this crate.
0,with health. My short-haired marmalade (15mos) practically glows in the dark. This food with no by products helps, I'm sure. But I also add a mix of minerals and such to each meal. I'll explain.	I found this book called *The Natural Cat", (I would insert a link if I knew how) by Anitra Frazier. It has lots of good stuff, but the best thing I've found is this recipe for a vit/min mix for your cat.		1.5 cups yeast powder (any food yeast, brewers, torula or nutritional. I use brewrers.	1/4 cup kelp powder or same of mixed trace mineral powder	1 cup lecithin granules	2 cups wheat brand (not germ)	2 cups bone meal, calcium lactate, or calcium gluconate		I started her as a kitten with a half tsp in each meal, and now she's grown she gets a round tbl per. The lecithin is remarkable for her coat. I've never seen a short hair so glossey, She loves being brushed, but that's just "gilding the lily." The brewers yeast keeps the fleas, mites and paracites away. Really! She didn't have any  vermin all summer, saving me a $45 vet fee and a $85  Frontline fee. And I just had her checked for worms and she's clean.		For this to work you must use it at all times, no running out or you lose the effect. It cost me less than the vet fees for all the ingredients which I get from Amazon. I do have Prime, which certainly helps.		Hope some of you find this interesting. I keep everything in glass, no plastic.
0,Pup loves how this tastes which is great.  I got it as a preventative as my pup is prone to hip and joint issues.
0,We already love this booster seat. I will post an update with picture of my Maltese enjoying his new car seat. I've got the Medium size in gray color since the seats of my Honda Civic EX Coupe are gray. Matches perfectly and fits great on the back seat. The height is also perfect, right for him to look through the window, he is 7,5 lbs and the size is right for him.
0,I love it!  Well made, easy to hang... but my cat prefers my couch!  grrr....  Not a reflection of the product, just a stubborn cat.
0,Cats live it.  Great action and even my oldest can't resist it.
0,The BEST catnip toys on the market! Expensive but really worth it. The ONLY catnip toys my 6 cats would play with.
0,Cats eat it and it's a great deal considering they're about 70 cents a can at the Markets
0,My cat is very finicky. I serve him only three varieties to vary his diet. He likes this variety but much prefers the gilled chunk meats, but he'll finish up most of this variety.
0,great low price
0,my dogs love these.
0,This is basically a shower mat like the ones that advertise on Television that you can put in the washing machine. It works. I think I should have shopped for something a little bigger, but it does the job.
0,I love this pooper scooper. I was tired of picking up my German Shepherd poop, and breaking my back doing it with a glove and bag. And this thing works as advertised. I couldn't be happier. Would definitely recommend to anybody.
0,My dog likes this flavor a lot. I bought something else before and he was like meh so I only buy beneful now.
0,The fit is great and my dog doesn't seem to mind it!
0,Obviously I think my dog looks adorable all the time, but this dress is precious. She is a 15 pound Shiba Inu. It's definitely short on her, but the chest fits well and I don't think the length matters too much.
0,I can never find just this style of Nylabone locally. They alway come in a three pack, and the dogs do not like the other two styles in the pack. So she ends up using one bone out of the three pack. I wish they sold three packs of just this style...
0,Great size, quite big!!
0,My dogs were very happy to work on some dog training, and get these as a reward for a job well done. I love that they are small, because you can give more treats without over doing it. These are definitely dog approved, and I will be purchasing more of these again soon!
0,Comfortable weight and fast charging
0,These are nice and big!  My boxer and Dane both love to play with these.  Somehow they are still in tact.
0,My dog has had different kinds of purebites before. She wasn't as thrilled with the Bison liver as she is with the other flavors.
0,We have been using Puppia Harnesses for our two Doxies for about 10 years now.  We find they walk better with a harness then with a collar.  They also use a car seat with seat belts.  They have to use a harness as  a collar would choke them.  We find Puppia Harnesses to be of good quality.  There are a lot of imitators out there now but so far none beats the Puppia.
0,these are nice and thick however they are too long for the cat box my daughter has
0,Works well, I like the multiple types of filters all in one. Great price.
0,Nice shampoo for no fragrence
0,This is a great way of having a litter box in a room, but completely camouflaged.  It is a nice piece of furniture, and is perfect (especially if you have dogs) to keep the cat bowls on top so the dogs can't get to them.  We love it!
0,great
0,Perfect for mydog
0,My dog is super obsessed with this! Easy to clean. Very easy to throw and flexible enough for the dog to chew.
0,Basically love the item and was looking for cheaper refills.
0,got rid of dog urine smell near my hot tub platform
0,I created a table to compare Science Diet Mature Adult Indoor cat food with the Royal Canin Indoor Mature, which is MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE at more than $3/lb. They both have comparable good ingredients such as taurine, fish oil, lots of vitamins... but what made me buy Royal Canin, despite the higher price, is it has glucosamine and chondroitin, both recommended by my vet for joint health. Those ingredients may be in extremely small, trace amounts, but Science Diet did not list them at all. I wish they came in larger quantity bags but maybe then the price will scare consumers.
0,Our fussy dog loves everything we have purchased from them.
0,My dog has been taking this supplement since end of 2013.  He likes the taste and I think it is working.  No problems so far.
0,My cat loves this!
0,My puppy loves this toy!  She has chewed the tail almost down to nothing!  So far safe and nothing has come off or loose.
0,This is a good product, but the only thing I don't like about it is that it can settle to the bottom of a bucket or feed bin.  If the texture could be made a little bit more "sticky" so the product would adhere to the feed, the horse would consume it rather than leave it.
0,Looks great! The material is nice and thick, it feels substantial and not flimsy. It's a little heavier than other collars my dog has worn but it doesn't seem to bother him. For reference I have a 10 lb. yorkie-bichon mix and the size M fit perfectly.
0,I received a free item to review.		The smell of these bully sticks (made from cow's organ meat) is extremely strong - imagine rancid, rotting garbage in a hot August dumpster and you get the idea.		But to our yellow lab they might as well be crispy bacon strips on a cold winter morning - she goes absolutely nuts for them at first scent.		They're big and substantial and it takes her awhile to gnaw them down to chewable size - preferably outdoors if we can encourage her...		Just remember - no face licking after mealtime.
0,I bought this mat for our frenchie to use during the summer when he visits my dad who has no a/c.  Thank goodness I did.  It cools him down quickly and he loves to lay on it!
0,I have a 6 year old male Maine Coon cat who came to me as a kitten from the breeder with a strong recommendation to continue feeding him Royal Canin cat food. Three years ago during my cat's annual checkup, my vet found moderate to severe dental disease and a tooth that needed extraction, not uncommon in this breed. I had the dental work done and immediately switched him from the "Maine Coon" type of Royal Canin to the "Oral Sensitive 30" formula. For two years after the switch, my vet has given my cat a clean bill of dental health. Just last year, he found some plaque but nowhere near as serious as the first time. This year he will have a preventive dental cleaning. I feel that Royal Canin "Oral Sensitive 30" had contributed significantly to my cat's improved dental health.
0,I have been using these inserts forever. They are easy to use and work great.
0,Ordered from the warehouse and it came without instructions but it was still super easy to put together. The parts are stamped with corresponding letters, it took less than 5 minutes to put together.
0,I love it! This is so much fun to play with. Now instead of mucking around on my computer I can feed by dog treats ALL DAY. Just kidding but it really is fun. The picture is great with a very sharp image. It is very easy to set up with wifi, and I was surprised to find out that it works great and doesn't lag/freeze when viewing without wifi on my phone at work.	The treat tosser/dispenser works fine form me. I was worried about that because other reviews say it doesn't work at times. It's a fun feature, and has worked with both the small bag of treats they give you, and also with my dogs' kibble. It shoots out 1-3 pieces each time, and it plays a noise right before shooting them that you can customize with your own recording.	I also like that it emanates a light from the bottom which turns blue when it's being used aka someone is watching. It also comes with tape on the bottom that allows you to stick it to something so that your dog won't knock it over and manhandle it when they realize treats shoot out of there.	There is a very slight lag to the video, though I've timed it out at like...1 second. Ultimately I love this and everyone we show it to thinks it's the greatest thing. So entertaining!
0,I like that the wheels roll smoothly and the top latches shut.  I don't like that the wheels indent into the bottom, which causes food to get stuck and makes it hard to scoop out.  I also wish the lid didn't flip all the way open until it hits the back of the container.  My other container I replaced with this one had a lid that stopped at the top.
0,Great price and I still have it after about 5 months.  Carlos the mouse loves it!
0,My pugs love these and I do too!  So easy to fold up stand and collapse bowls for traveling to the lake on wekends!
0,I have a Staffordshire Terrier thats just over 3yrs old and this is his favorite toy. He is so gentle with his lamb and all his stuffed, squeakie toys. I know thats unusual for the breed but hes definitely not the normal pittie. He just loves them... He drops one on my pillow at night at bedtime and sleeps with one at the end of the bed... Theyre quite the pair..
0,I am a veterinarian technician and have been thoroughly educated on all of the major dog good brands. I was feeding my 8 year old Westhighland Terrier/ Yorkshire Terrier a different dog food (Purina pro-plan) and he was free fed , eating only when he was hungrey. Until my daughter started walking, that's when he started gobbling down his food all at once, in fear that she might eat his food (lol). He quickly gained 3 pounds over the winter, going from a healthy 15lbs. to an overweight 18lbs. I jog with my daughter in the stroller,  and him by my side every morning for 45 minutes, and with the exercise and the change in food ( hills science diet perfect weight small breed), I am happy to report he has lost the 3 extra pounds and looks trim and fit! Not only has he lost the extra pounds, but his hair and cost looks so shiney and healthy. I noticed a big difference in his step as well, it's like he is a puppy again, agile and swift. I am very pleased with the results and would recommend it to any of my clients that have a small breed for that needs to shed extra pounds.
0,For being less than $5, this is a fantastic cat toy.  The plastic stick bends just enough so that my cats can tug on it and have some fun before it bounces back.  The rope is made of colorful, soft, fleece-like cloth that the cats love to lay on.  They can claw at it, bite it, and carry it around the whole house.  It really appeals to the cats' hunter instinct.
0,My dogs love this bed.  Of all the ones they have, this has been the go to favorite.  It's not very plush, but thick enough to keep my 13 pounders comfortable.  It's very soft.  I've washed it quite a few times and it's holding up very well.  It's low profile and solid color allow it to fit in any room.
0,I first used the mango version of this spritz, but found that the scent was just too sickly sweet for me. I figured I'd try this one, and it's perfect. It has a subtle undertone of eucalyptus, but not so much that you'd think the dog bathed at a day spa.
0,Exactly as described. Nice bright colors and what seems like durable material. Great to bring to my mom's house whenever my dog goes to visit his "grandma" or to outdoor activities with the pup. Can't beat the price.
0,Very well made. Love the handle on the back, give extra control if needed.
0,My dog loves these balls...4th order
0,My puppy is obsessed with the hedgehog!!
0,My cat loves this toy. Other wand toys can't compare. The wire makes the toy more unpredictable and life like. He will play with this toy for an hour straight, take a break while keeping an eye on it, then go back for more. Definitely worth the investment.
0,My Golden Retriever developed a benign mass on his right flank.  It grew to basket ball size (20lbs.), so when it was removed, he had a huge "y"-shaped incision that started on his flank, ran down his side, over his thigh and past his knee.  It required about 100 staples.  We did not use a cone when he had the 1st biopsy a year ago, never saw him so much as look at his incisions & staples, but slowly and surely, he quietly took all of them out.		For post-surgery, due to the massive incision, I looked for an alternative to hard plastic e-collars and found the Comfy Cone.  It works quite well and I am extremely pleased.  The only slight issue is that due to the weight of the buckle on his collar, the top where the sides of the Comfy Collar meet, tend to slip down under his chin.  Other than that, Hunter barely seems to notice the Comfy Cone and sleeps quite comfortably with it in place.		HERE ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS:  Before using, (1) position the Comfy Cone so that it is open and under your pet's chin. Do not close it yet around your pet's face.  Allow your pet to sniff and explore the Comfy Cone  (2)  speak calmly to your pet while introducing the Comfy Cone and anytime you secure it (3) secure it while speaking gently and offering verbal praise to your pet (4)  if your pet is resistant, offer a 'high value' treat(small pieces cut up, cooked chicken or hot dogs) only after the Comfy Cone is secured, and (4)frequently take time to reach inside the cone to rub your pet's head & offer praise  while the Comfy Cone is on.  Any pet will buck and resist the Comfy Cone if you approach them too quickly with a foreign object that obscures their peripheral vision.  Make it a pleasant, calm experience and reinforce it with praise.
0,Phenomenal system that keeps the floor surrounding the litter clean!
0,My new kitten loves his awesome space ship back pack! I always leave it out unzipped so he can play in it. Doing this makes it super easy to get him to go in to take a ride to the store or vet. Everyone at the vets office went crazy when they saw my cool backpack they loved the bubble window and so does my little cat Petrie.
0,We have been using this particular Drinkwell model for 5 or 6 years and this is our third one. The last one developed a leak around the motor housing I think from removing the motor for cleaning which was a real pain. This new fountain has a new design for the motor and has made cleaning the unit much more user friendly. The flow control knob is also new and it makes adjusting the water flow much easier. We have 2 big outdoor cats around 18 lbs each and they were lost without their fountain while we were waiting for this new one to arrive. Well this fountain has made them happy and I'm really happy about the new design.
0,Sentry Fiproguard Plus for Cats contains the same ingredients as the Fiproguard for dogs except the amount of (S)-methoprene is 11.8 % instead of 8.8 %.  So, the cat's version has 34 % more (S)-methoprene than the dog's ones.  The cat's packaging cost (prices tend to change):	3 or 6 x 0.017 fl oz (0.50 ml) at $29 or $36-$50 = $569/fl oz ($19.33/ml) or $353-$490/fl oz ($12-$16.7/ml).	For comparison, the dog's version costs from:	1-22 lbs: 3 or 6 x 0.023 fl oz (0.67 ml) at $14.44 or $16.09 = $209/fl oz ($7.18/ml) or $117/fl oz ($4.0/ml)	to as little as:	89-132 lbs: 3 or 6 x 0.136 fl oz (4.02 ml) at $15.31 or $15.02 = $38/fl oz ($1.27/ml) or $25/fl oz ($0.83/ml).	Thus, the cat's version is up to over 23 times (23289 %) more expensive than the cheapest version of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/6-applicators-for-dogs-89-132-lbs/dp/B00QO2CN6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">6 applicators for dogs 89-132 lbs</a>.
0,I take my dogs for a walk twice a day and always wear these fabulous bags. I love the handles so it does not slip.		They are very popular in my neighborhood.		I recommend them widely.
0,This is an excellent product. It is easy to use and a good value. I use quite a few different Seachem products and have always found them to be excellent quality. I highly recommend this product.
0,Great for the dog, she loves them ! Great treat and good for bad breath!
0,we are hoping it keep his teeth clean
0,good blankets for my little pets.  They are very compfortable and the animals enjoy laying in them.
0,Casey really loves it
0,I mix a handful with Wellness canned food, and my little Coton likes that just fine .. but I can't get her to eat the crunchy food by itself.  I do like the brand though, and it seems to agree with puppy's digestion, and she's doing just fine healthwise.
0,Great product, my dogs Love it! FAST SHIP  .... I never have to worry about the pet store being out of my babies food again! Thanks Amazon!
0,a life saver for my carpet.
0,This is a great sweater.  We live in NW Montana, and my St. Poodle was cold even in the house after getting groomed.  The temps were hovering right around 0 degrees, so I just put her coat on over her sweater.  Glad I bought the X-Large....she's only 50 lbs, but a smaller size would have been too small.
0,my dog wears this all the time in cold weather
0,Keeps claws trimmed down.  i like ability to spread them throughout the cage at different levels.  Birds seem to like them too.
0,I love these towelettes!  I keep them with in the bag with my yoga mat and use them to wipe down my yoga mat bore class. The are antibacterial and smell great. Highly recommend!
0,great value
0,awesome! perfect fit and it is nice enough to have people sit on even if not pets are there
0,My cats preference.  Any Fancy Feast!  Wonderful to purchase through Amazon for convenience and value. Highly recommended. A++
0,he loved these
0,I've gone through so many sets of doggie boots and somehow all of them got twisted and came loose after a few minutes of wearing. Always a big challenge to keep them from sliding or dogs pulling them off because they never fit well. But finally found the ones really work!!!		The biggest difference with these boots is the foam (pads) inside.  It really makes easier to secure and tighten them without hurting the dog.  This design is very impressive. I also like the durable material (please refer to the pictures I posted).		I purchased Large size (3-1/4" wide) which is 1/4" wider than my dog's paw's width (3") and they fit perfectly on my German Shepherd Mix (82 lb.) Just make sure to spread your dog's paw a little bit when you take measurements because that will be the width when they are standing and putting their weight on their feet.		Conclusion - These are well made, well designed boots and I am completely satisfied.  Strongly recommend to others.
0,Works great!
0,Bought this for my boyfriend and his Australian shepherd who is obsessed with fetching tennis balls. They BOTH love it! Easy and fun to use and has a good distance on it.
0,This filter pad material works well in both my HOB and canister filter. Easy to cut to size and doesn't fall apart at 3 week changing intervals.
0,My two cats live for crunchy treats.  They go through small bags so quickly, so I was happy to find these treats in larger bags.
0,Love the product.  Very healthy and balanced diet.
0,It is important to me to have a stand with my scooper and this one holds up.  I foster kittens and this has lasted a long time and held up.  Great product and large scoop.
0,Came fast.  My dog was not that impressed by the taste but accepts it.
0,Last longer than most rawhide bones. Our dog loves these!
0,Excellent for our German Shepherd !!
0,It's so cute!
0,This is a good product. I thought the bags were too small and I might have issues picking up after my 79 pound dog, but they work just fine. Love the handles so it is convenient to carry during our walks.
0,Amazing results with this product.  My 12 year old/90 lb  Boxer has had problems getting up and being comfortable when lying down.  After using Cosequin DS, he is getting around a lot faster, runs short distances and appears much more comfortable when in his bed.
0,I bought this for my 6 mth old GR who's pretty smart I think but even then it took a bit of trial and error and encouragement on my part to get him to play with it. He was afraid of it at the start so I had to give him treats just for touching it. But once he got started, he loved it! He tried to chew it but realized that didn't get the treats out so I had to demonstrate pushing it and turning it over many times before he got the idea.
0,Pet Naturals Calming is a safe and natural way to address your feline's over excitement and even depression. I use the Calming on my indoor and outdoor cats - usually on days where they are bouncing off walls! It helps calm the animal and relax them. Pet Naturals Calming supplement helps on days where depression is obvious and will provide suttle yet overall improvement usually after using two or three days.
0,We took in an abandoned cat, so now we have three.  We needed to either buy another litter box (so we would have two), so I purchased this litter pan because I really liked the two compartments on the side for the scoop (or whatever).  I didn't pay attention to the "Giant" word in the title--oops!  So when it arrived, and found it was HUGE, I was really surprised.  We have limited space, so I thought I would have to send it back.  However, we have found that we can get rid of our smaller pan and only use this one for our three cats.  They seem to love it much more than the smaller pan--they have plenty of room to do their business.  We scoop it daily and it fits our needs.  We did have to do some re-arranging in our utility room to make it fit, but very happy with purchase.  The two little compartments on the side helps a great deal with our large metal scooper.
0,Good but VERY expensive!
0,This is the best price I've found for pill pockets.  I will buy from them again in the future.
0,My cats like those type of balls i just didn't find these to be great quality. these balls didn't bounce very high. My cats still liked them. They were ok i guess.
0,The quality is good durable for strong chewers. Strongly recommend for strong chewers.	Can place treats biscuits for fun playing!
0,Bought the same one in red last year, fits my westie perfect size L & lightweight & comfortable. Adjusts to size around the body. Would order again from seller! AAA
0,durable
0,Easy to assemble and my cats love it.
0,Wow..We have been using these filters for awhile and know they work excellent for us but the price at our local pet supply is more then double then the seller (EntirelyPets) charges here on amazon. Very fast shipping.
0,Limited ingredients is what we need here for 5 dogs. They love it.
0,This product is a life saver! Our dogs HATED walks more than anything. They are getting so big and would pull so hard. We tried everything, but this is the golden ticket!!!
0,Both my cat and dog are crazy for this product.  As it is freeze-dried, it is great to transport while on the road and traveling with pets.
0,Favorite of my parakeets, cockatiel and parrotlett.  This food is always fresh and I feed it to them daily, this disappears within an hour.
0,Cats love it

0,I have a golden retriever and this is lovely. Works perfectly, I have no complains. I refill it about once a week
0,Quality item at a reasonable price with fast delivery! I was able to select the design, color and what I wanted inscribed on the tag. I definitely recommend the company and product.
0,Exactly what I wanted and expected.
0,Works great better than earlier models
1,not one hatched
1,Snapped in half durng first use.
1,The dogs loved it, but it didn't last 2 hours.  Pricey for a very disposable toy.  If you don't have multiple dogs or heavy chewers, might be fine.
1,THE 12VOLT POWER GAVE UP THE GHOST AFTER 1 YEAR.  I WOULD LOOK A LITTLE HARDER FOR A MORE RELIABLE UNIT.
1,I purchased these to use on my toy poodles ears.  They wouldn't even grasp the hair tight enough to pull it out.  I can do a better job using just my fingers.
1,Unfortunately my cats didn't like this product. They like dried salmon and most anything tuna!
1,Even though it's advertised as easy to put together without screws or glue... it took me like 20 minutes to figure out how to slide it together. It doesn't come with instructions. I suppose it shouldn't have to, but I grew up in the age of Ikea, and at the least I need some infographic about where to slide the pieces. On top of it being difficult for me to put together, my chinchillas don't like it. It's not deep enough for them. It only fits one chinchilla at a time, which can be frustrating for bonded pairs that want to cuddle together. I recommend tubes or longer tunnel-like hiding houses for chinchillas.
1,I ended up returning this after one use as my white puppy turned black around his neck from the chain.  We ended up going with a Martingale collar for puppy training which we are still using six months later.  I liked how the collar looked and that it was not a full fledged choker chain, but the residue it left had me unsettled.  Amazon was wonderful during the return process.		Runs big-	I bought this collar as my puppy is in agility training and dog training classes and everyone has a choke collar which I am against.  I was using the Guardian, but we train other dogs also and the other owners were not handling the guardian collar correctly resulting in undue pulling on his nose.		My dog would be in a 20 inch choke chain which I won't buy so I bought the medium.  With the medium tightened all the way it is still too big.  I just purchased the small, but plan on keeping the medium as I know he will grow into it (he is only 4 1/2 months old).  So far it has not mattered as my dog does not pull due to all his training, but I did do a correction once when he chased a cat and he immediately went to my side.  I think this is perfect for dogs in training who are told to buy a choke collar.  He also only wears it for training purposes although I know many use them all the time.
1,Ordered this item, arrived without the clamp. Returned, ordered it again, again arrived without the clamp. Noted the lack of a clamp on both returns. Done with this item.
1,very small
1,My bunnies didn't like them at all. I gave it too them both and they looked at it smell it and took a small taste and that was it. They didn't eat them and they are just going to waste. If you are buying theses for your pet bunnies I wouldn't. You are just wasting your money. And if you are like me you hate doing that. I rather have kept my money instead of spending it on theses. I mean my bunnies are not fussy but they didn't like theses for some reason. But at the store I found and apple thing they do love to eat and that's what I buy and give to my pet bunnies. So don't buy them.
1,OK for rugs/mats, but not good for a domestic short hair cat. The pins are way too long and pointy, and the cat hates it. Plus, it wouldn't get much hair off the cat anyway.
1,Should only be used for temporary housing, breeding, etc.		Bettas need at least 2.5 (preferably 5) gallons, a heater an a filter to thrive.		And to those who are keeping a betta "safe" from cichlids, you shouldn't have been keeping the two together in the first place. They are by no means compatible.
1,No where near as good as the previous Litter Maid Cat box I had.  The chamber is a lot smaller and not convenient to remove.  Litter is getting everywhere.
1,I have a chihuahua. She weighs 12 lbs. These tonka toy stairs would repeatedly collapse on her as she tried to make her weigh up to my bed. She would whine to be picked up and placed on the bed, but I made her use the stairs and BOOM! They would collapse. I basically set her up to fail and she would be constantly nervous to use them and whine to be carried up -- which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. Perhaps the locking hole is too big, but this thing would fall down like a bunch of bricks! All my animals are less than 13 lbs. You would think this could withstand that! I do not recommend these. I would go with stairs that are not collapsable into pieces as they have a high likelihood of just falling apart. I went with another set of stairs (still plastic) but came in one solid piece with a retractable stand. Problem solved and it was literally $9 more than this. What a waste! I don't even want to give them away in fear of further traumatizing an animal. So if you have a hamster these stairs would probably do well.
1,This scared me AND my girls... no bueno.
1,it did not really work for me (my dog). i am using it often as directed on my dog and it does not repel anything for days. i did not observe any long lasting flea control from this product. i was hoping that it would work but it did not. thank you.
1,GSD destroyed this toy in only 4 short days. I bought this based on product reviews about how durable and tough it was made and what a disappointment.  Total waist of money for the amount of time the product lasted. Pro: Size. That's it!	Con: Material, Durability, Price	Do Not Recommend
1,Doesn't clump and doesn't seal the odor for my 16 year old cat. It just smells like he peed on the floor,  when is actually the litter that just sucks! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS GREAT THOUGH!
1,Have bought these since they came out, but the last two packages have come with wraps small as a noodle.  Only 1 rawhide was regular size.  Very disappointed especially since the price went up 30% as well.  Can't believe they're a Kong product.
1,It was on sale, so I bought it but my cat would not touch it. She's apparently brand specific. Smells really, really strong compared to her other food which might be part of the reason she won't eat it.
1,The ingredients are disgusting too. Yuck!
1,Buyer Beware - this is a Really cheap piece of faux fur that looks absolutely horrible.  They took a square of scruff, seamed two sides together, and put a drawstring at one end.  That's it - nothing special - and it looks as cheap as it is.  An added insult was that the blasted drawstring didn't work!
1,Order the correct size per the web page directions but received one that was the stated size that only went half way down my dogs back.  Poor sizing!  Returned.
1,I usually use Feliway and order it online which is much cheaper.  I ran out j and decided to try the Nutri-Vet again.  I tried it a couple of years ago but the Feliway worked better. I ran out and cringe at paying $30 in the store, when I started buying it was under $25.  I decided to try the Nutri-Vet again until I could order more Feliway, what a mistake, it smells like a Glade Plug-in and it was so over powering I had to unplug it.  Over the years I have developed a sensitivity to perfume smells, I can't even go through the candle aisle in the stores.  The first time I tried them, they didn't have the perfume smell they have now.		I will go back to using a cheaper spray pump bottle that seems to work OK and has little smell.  I just have to remember to spray it every day until my order comes in.		If you like plug-in air fresheners then you may love this.  I really have a problem with everything having to have a scent.  I really believe that we are over dosing ourselves and it has negative effects on all of us.		For those who have cats who don't like to use a litter box to urinate.  We adopted a cat, knowing that she didn't urinate in the box, but beside it.  She didn't have a problem pooping in the same litter box as the other cats. We decided to try putting down a puppy pee pad next to the box and the problem was solved.  She always used the pad, she just didn't like urinating in a box with poop in it.
1,I bought this pump back on September 15th 2015 and it quit working today took it apart the impeller came out with the magnet was frozen in there so after spinning hour and the phone with Amazon just to try to get the phone number for aqua clear witches 800 724-2436 after talking to her for about 15 minutes she told me I need a new pump the pump is still under warranty they refuse to replace it because they said I did not clean the magnet I just cleaned impeller I don't think this is right they're not standing behind their product and being that I bought tons of filters and pumps from them for all my fish tanks which is 10 of them I will never buy AquaClear product again thank you
1,Great idea but it doesnt work. There is not enough padding to form a seal around my dogs head/ear area. So it doesnt block out the noise, just makes him uncomfortable. I tried two different sizes and both had the same issue. I put my human Bose headphones on him, they worked so much better and he was more comfortable.
1,Didnt work on my cats chronic diarrhea, going to try a different brand, it's not a parasite so how we are hoping its food allergies and not IBD!
1,The case I got yesterday was short 2 cans. Please replace.
1,Thin useless pads, I would use anything besides these, they leak, thin material.. Thank good ness I only bought 100, I have to double them up and they still suck..
1,Looks like a great product only if it could work on my dog. The plastic tray has a crack on the edge when it arrived.  The artificial grass was made of cheap plastic that fall all over the places when I took the patch out from the box. It came with 2 pieces of grass patches which was nice but they have strong plastic odor that was a turn off.  My dog would not do her business on it.  I was disappointed.
1,The bag is very difficult to re-seal.  My cat stuck her nose up after the second day the bag was opened.
1,Edited: After having this vest for a couple of months, the plastic tag area on the top of the vest has ripped. Having the leash attachment connected to this plastic tag holder is a poor design choice. I will have to replace the vest now and I will not be purchasing this vest again.		Fits as expected. Velcro patches are a nice touch for if they need to be replaced.
1,We've had this door for a month.  It seems to be well made but I question it's safety.  We noticed the cats' tails were coming close to getting caught in the door because the plastic door flap is rigid and has enough weight to allow it to drop closed as a cat walks through. Still we didn't anticipate what happened a few nights ago.  Sitting quietly watching TV, we were suddenly horrified to hear the most blood cuddeling screams coming from one of our cats.  I could have sworn someone was killing her.  As we followed the cries to the cat door, there she was with her paw caught under the door flap.  Her reflexes were to pull her paw back but the harder she tried to pull her paw out, the more it wedged between the door flap and the frame.  No matter which way I pushed the door, she was wedged in so tightly, I was going to break the bones in her paw just to get it out.  I finally used a metal ruler to pry the door straight up enough to free her.  We had just returned from a trip and I can't imagine how horrible it would have been for the cat if we had been gone and our friend, who looked in on the cats once a day, would have found her caught in that door for who knows how long.  While the locking feature is nice, the door needs to be redesigned with a more flexible flap or one that gives enough clearance for a paw or even a cat's head.
1,Returning it. Tried to use it once and it leaked...alot.
1,I have no idea if this is working or not. it's really flimsy, I mean, REALLY flimsy, like a cheap child's toy. returned.
1,Come on guys it only takes five seconds to wake this thing out of 'deep sleep mode' , which preserves the battery charge on the transmitter, and then you can resume correcting your pet! Didn't find this a great drawback with my Basset Hound which would take off like a rocket whenever he saw a squirrel or rabbit. He began responding immediately to just the vibration setting and on rare occasions would require the beeping sound as a secondary deterrent . Have never even needed to use the shock setting and he has already learned not to leave our property when chasing a critter. This training collar works very well, is very inexpensive and very easy to recharge. If you're not expecting perfection for less than fifty dollars you should be more than happy with this product.		Addendum:	A little over a year after purchasing this the collar can not longer be charged! Bought the recharging collar to save myself the hassle of changing batteries. Now unit is completely worthless to me as it stopped working right after the one year warranty ended.
1,somehow my boxer still managed to rip through this bed. bummer.
1,Pomeranian loves it.  Comes with extra squeaker.  My dog is very gentle with toys and the leg came off within a few minutes.
1,It started falling apart right out of the box
1,The product had no effect on the urine stain on my wood floor. It was no more effective than the product I tried previously, Urine Gone, I believe.
1,Does not work on the couches very well. The cats just tear it right off.. it doesn't stick enough to the fabric. Maybe this would be useful for counters or something, but I got it for furniture and it just doesn't work. It's also very very hard to apply.
1,I bought two of these for vet visit. The big zipper at the end of each one broke the first time I tried to zip and unzip. I needed them for an emergency so I hand sewed them shut and used the small zipper at the other end. I would not recommend these at all. The old reliable plastic ones still endure the best.
1,I don't think my review is really fair because my cat has issues. Any extra oil exacerbates his already sensitive gastrointestinal system. I bought this to see if the liquid would work because it was cheaper than the solid treat type pro-biotic I give him currently. It didn't. But that doesn't mean that this is not a good product.
1,We were SO disappointed at how this product performed - which is to say, not at all!  The dog next door continued to bark regardless.  We returned it for credit, thanks to amazon's return policy.
1,The one cat I bought this for had an odd attraction to it (he's a sweet oddball anyway)....so I tried it on the others (me-cat lady) and nothing. Well that was disappointing...		* I bought this product at PetSmart...came to Amazon looking for something that may work...suggestion?
1,My dog would not eat it. Must have some type of sugar in it as it drew ants and other dog food next to it did not. I thought Nutro was a really good brand but now I don't think so.
1,Ordered by mistake and returned.
1,Although this looks like what I ordered, it does not look like this, the green lining is not there. There were no instructions on how to use it, there are two straps that I have not idea what to do with.  My dog can still jump over hte sides and into the front seat.
1,didn't hold its color or printing
1,I just gave this product away after reading some Hartz and Sargeants review of killing a shih tzu. I have 3 shih tzus that don't want to murder.....Fipronil is as Frontline, but the other ingredient doesn't, so, I just didn't dare to use it.
1,Neither of my cats will use this bed.  They both checked it out and haven't used it again since the first time.  It's nice and soft, and I really thought it would be perfect for them and was planning on ordering a second one so they could each have their own.  Maybe they'll take to it eventually.
1,Horrible quality. Fasteners do not hold tight, and the divider is so lax that my dog fits through the side. Not even usable in my opinion
1,Though Waggin Train claims these chicken jerky tenders dog treats are OK (at a serving of half a treat) for small dogs dogs over five pounds after reading some of the reviews I am not going to let my twelve year old Yorkie try them.  He's on a low protein diet and even though his vet says the occasional meat based treat is OK I am not going to risk it.  Yes, I should have read the reviews more thoroughly before ordering but I didn't.
1,I was very disappointed with this item. Every time my cat uses the litter box, the liner rips and makes for stiffing impossible. If you are lucky enough not to have a tear in the liner when you attempt to sift, it does not stiff very well and you end up scooping anyway. If I do try another type of liner it would have to be a mesh type liner, one that is much stronger. Also, I would empty litter everyday and not allow it to become too heavy.
1,Dog tore it apart in minutes. I had to throw it away.
1,Bird was too immobile and didn't wobble much. Cats wouldn't touch it. Unfortunately had to return it
1,NONE OF MY 8 CATS  ATE IT
1,We used to have one of the Marshall Ferret Octo-Play for our ferrets.  One day while we were playing with our ferrets, my girl, Zoe, ran into the Octopus.  I noticed what looked like her 'struggling' so I checked on her.  She had the threads from the INSIDE wrapped around her neck!!!!  I tried to slip my finger between the threads and her neck and couldn't even get my finger between her neck and the threads.  I yelled for my husband and he came over with his pocket knife (the whole time I'm telling him not to cut her) and he slipped it between and cut the threads.  Our poor baby girl was shaking so bad!  If we had not been right there, she would have died!  The ferrets had shredded the inside of that thing and you couldn't tell it by looking at it!  We threw that thing away!  If you have one or if you buy one, inspect it daily to make sure it is safe for your pet!
1,Gave this to my three dogs...Doberman, standard poodle, and dane/mastiff mix. I transitioned slowly from old food to this food, but dogs did not react well. Poodle did fine with it (and she is usually sensitive to foods), but Doberman and Dane both suffered reoccurring diarrhea and my Doberman began suffering from allergies (itchy, flaky skin, losing patches of hair, watery eyes, ear infections, red blotches on belly). I'm sure this formula may work for some dogs, but it did not go over well with mine.
1,Didn't work with my dog. I also didn't receive the free gift that was advertised.
1,No instructions and no clue how it works!
1,First, the teeth on the comb are so far apart I don't know how they could even detect a knot in my dog's fur. Second, but maybe more important, the noise it makes when the button is pressed is terrible. My dog is afraid of It and runs away. Last, the instructions say "Do not remove animal fur from the blade by hand. Use the enclosed pick ....." The pick is on the bottom of the back cover and it requires a Phillips screwdriver to remove it so it can be used. This tool is not what I expected at all.
1,the cord blew up for no reason while i was sleeping.  Electrocuted my fish. and killed them. it was on a surge protector, when the timer was turning the light on, it blew up. luckily i was home sleeping it made a very loud bang and woke me and my animals up luckily my house didn't catch fire and my fur kids were not injured or killed. I  purchased Feb 28 and it blew up Oct 19 . Topdogsellers made the remark that my fish are not going to die from lack of light.... NO, THEY DIED FROM ELECTROCUTION and Topdogsellers is making no attempt to do anything other than make smart remarks.
1,My dogs did love this bed but I sadly I had to watch it constantly. The bed folds and there is an opening on the sides of the bed where your dog would jump on/off the cot. My dogs legs went thru the hole, of course they started screaming. I zip tied foam pipe insulation to the frame to prevent this from happening again. Next issue is I have 13lb dogs, their nails if not trimmed constantly obviously come to a tiny point, that is the next issue, my dogs nails would get caught in the mesh. I had these for 2 years, used outside brought in during bad weather, they lasted only 2years when the material dry rotted and totally split. The company does not offer replacement covers sadly so this will be filling the landfills as each of these beds ever purchased falls apart..not a very GREEN concept...
1,Disappointed!! Very small and cheap, not many squeakers at all and the one didn't last or squeak much.
1,The poles and the jump are so flimsy and easily knocked over they are valueless.  The tunnel is okay for indoor play.  This set is way overpriced!
1,My dog is 26.5 lb.  When I pressed the button for a split second (trying to be careful) at shock level 1, he *screamed*, and it was like his entire body jolted, sideways, into the air about a foot and a half.  He was very fearful for hours afterward.  This collar is advertised for very stubborn dogs, so, being stubborn, my dog doesn't respond to the tone or the vibrate setting.  The manual emphasizes that if the dog yelps, the shock setting is too high, so, of course, we have nowhere to go from here.  I had to return it rather than torture my dog.		Maybe this device is kinder to much larger dogs, but I can't imagine it being humane even at shock level 1 for any dog under 80 pounds.  I can't imagine anything over shock level 2, *maybe* 3, being acceptable for any dog owner to use on any dog, of any size.  If you get this collar, be VERY, very careful.  It is NOT okay to torture a defenseless animal for any purpose, least of all convenience.  They never chose to be domesticated.  We owe them decency.
1,Only used it for two weeks before it broke.
1,Didn't like this at all
1,didn't work, product returned
1,Useless; tried and tried to adjust and never did get the dog to react...it just made a slight whistle noise and the dog did hear that but I could blow it "loudly" next to him w/o any reaction
1,They didn't fit into the bone the right way.  Always a different shape.  My puppy like them plain but that's not why I bought them.
1,I see all these good reviews but maybe I'm doing something wrong. First time it cleaned on it's own, it scared my cat. It scared her enough that she didn't use the litter box for a few days.  So I have to unplug it and when I see her go, I'll take her out of the room and then let it clean. The crystals DO NOT absorb the poop or urine.  The poop gets stuck in the rails.		I don't really like it. :(
1,Pump failed
1,Poorly made duck- I've had previous ones that have lasted months and this one wore out in less than a week just by my pom/yorkie mix carrying it.
1,Top broke as soon as i got it out the box!
1,Fragrance free does not block ANY odor and I clean the litter box daily.  I would never buy fragrant free again.
1,We've been using these for a few days now but there seems to be little to no affect on my cat.
1,Didn't work for us
1,I bought the clicker not knowing what to expect. Didn't work for me. Snapping my finger does better ---or using one of his squeak toys.	However--the little kids who come to my house love to play with it so it was not a total loss!
1,This Jumbo came with no squeakers anywhere?
1,I have three dogs.  A German Shepherd (90 pounds) an English Bulldog (55 pounds but big shoulders) and a German Shepherd/beagle mix.  While all three of them *can* make it through the door, it is a very tight fit, especially for the bulldog.  Unfortunately, I bought it two months ago, which is outside the Amazon return period or I would return it.  The size bigger doesn't look much bigger as the flap is only an inch wider.  The doggie door it replaced is no longer made, but it was also an "extra large" and was twice as wide.  The pluses are that installation was very easy and the area where I have it, which had previously been very cold, is much warmer.
1,Flimsy.  It bended down toward the bottom of the tank on its own weight.
1,Gets dirty too fast, pain to clean, noisy.  I like their old version better. I gave this one away.
1,Tiny writing and not very easily determined because the numbers are split between both side of the scale. But not worth trouble of returning and it does not get looked at that often
1,I have a drinkwell fountain for my 3 cats.  However, when these replacement filters arrived, they were useless to me as they were a tad too big.  I tried to force them in, but finally gave up and bought them from Petco.
1,Gota defected product. :(
1,They aren't as strong as I thought they would be. My dog is a chewer and will go right through them. These may work with an older dog - more subdued - who won't chew them.
1,I put this on my Rottweiler... The Second time I took him out, he slipped the one strap off his nose and into his mouth... He kept his mouth shut and when he opened it, the strap broke... This thing lasted All of like 30 min... Dont Waste Your Money...
1,Battery will not hold a charge, ad is misleading, there are no replaceable batteries the battery is part of the unit. Returning unit for exchange.
1,Puppy destroyed in one hour .  So much for chew guard!!
1,Not impressed!  I don't feel like they really improve the softness or heal the roughness on either my hands or feet.
1,The bow ties neck strings are too long for my chihuahua. They fit very loosely. Very unhappy.
1,Very chip but worst ingredient ever.
1,Dog shredded it in about 2 seconds
1,I don't understand and I am a medical professional. Directions say daily dose is 50mg/kg (22.7mg/lb or .0227 grams/lb) of body weight. I am using lbs. My animal weighs 38.5lbs. That calculation would then be .0227grams/lb x 38.5lbs = .873 grams or 873.17 mg per day, not even 1 gram (1 pouch of 1 gram size) per day. But then the package daily dose by pouch size states: 10 lbs for 1 gram, 11-20lbs 2 grams, 21-30 3 grams, 31-40lbs 4 grams. So which is it? less than 1 gram a day x 3 days or 4 grams daily x 3 days?		One of my other dogs as a puppy, 10 years ago once got into a flavored liquid dewormer for puppies and ODed, he had neurological symptoms, gait was awry/walked around drunk. Why the contradictory information?		Amazon has the picture of the package so one can see the contradictory directions for yourself.
1,None of my cats would even try this let alone take it with a pill inside. I didn't read close enough to see that it is bacon flavored. I've never had a cat that would have anything to do with bacon, I love it, they don't, lol.
1,For my puppy it was way too small, I'm guessing that I didn't read well enough the measurements. IT looks pretty though.
1,Too loud. Tried a sponge, all sorts of things, no luck.
1,bow feel apart 2 day.
1,This dog vest is not rugged enough to deal with the brush and shrubs we have around here.  Needs to be made of heavier material.
1,Runs way too small.
1,My betta tore its fins after placing this plant in the tank. It was the only fish in the tank and the first fake plant I placed in the tank with it. Large fin fish beware of this!
1,Teeny, tiny strings of chicken wrapped around the rawhide.  The picture doesn't really them justice. Don't waste your money.
1,The suction cup on the bottom of this product would not stay stuck (even when moistened) to the bottom of the stainless steel flat bottomed dog food bowl I feed my dog with.  It just was not concave enough...just flat.  I returned it...too bad...it's a great idea!
1,I have paperwork/receipt to prove I purchased this from Amazon in Feb 2016, not sure why it doesn't show as a verified purchase!  These scratchers get cardboard pieces all lover, clean up is daily.  I was willing to over look the mess & bother when they were only $5.79 (Feb 2016), but they have gone up 300%!  Yes 300% (as of this posting)! They are now cheaper to buy at the local pet store, but I am not going to spend that kind of money on cardboard that the cat will tear to shreds, so I made my own scratcher.  I took a scrap piece of  1" plywood, cut it to the same size as the insert and glued a piece of industrial berber to each side (I may get a staple gun to use on future models LOL that way I can reuse the wood).  I put it in the existing Kong frame and voila, a no mess scratcher!  And my cat uses it (I did have to rub a little catnip on it, but once she sunk her nails into it she was hooked).  hmmmmm maybe I need to start my own business!  If you aren't handy, I'm sure your local pet store will appreciate the business.  Also the replacements for this Kong Scratcher are more expensive than the whole unit at my local pet store...just sayin...
1,Destroyed in less than 5 minutes by young Rottie pup. ATE, literally the canvas ribbons off.
1,puppy was not interested, chilled or room temp. just tore it apart.
1,Crappy material and quality do not reccommend.
1,The consistency of these was NOT like the original ones I usually buy... My dog seemed to like it but I don't think I will buy again...
1,In less than 10 minutes our 15 lb Cockapoo had holes chewed in it
1,The bag it's self does the job but they at are nearly impossible to separate! We are assuming that the reason they don't pull out of the holder (bone) well is lack of a plastic or other type of tube in the middle, we haven't reached the middle yet to confirm that but you can't see or feel one from either end. If you have the patience to carefully separate the bag before you need it these would work well but if your used to just "popping" the bag off quickly when needed these aren't for you.
1,The dogs hate these.  I don't know if it's the smell of them, but they try to get away from them.  They aren't moist enough to get the job done.
1,This product is made in China.
1,Bought this after reading so many positive reviews. Tried it on my cat and dogs, giving them the daily recommended dose for a few months. Unfortunately, the fleas still jump on them and bite them.
1,Does NOT stay in. It also isn't tall enough.
1,This toy is not appropriate for any dog with a mouth and teeth. It is soft latex with an attached tongue which unfurls when belly is pressed. My very gentle, 22 lb Yorkie mix pulled the tongue out with one tug and began taking bites off of the body. Unless you have a dog content to watch you play with this appealing toy, I'd suggest you save your money.
1,Bayer has stopped making Advantage with the single active ingredient Imidacloprid, and some suppliers are substituting Advantage II which also has Pyripoxyfen as an active ingredient.  The picture of the product and the billing information indicate that you are ordering regular Purple Advantage for cats over 9 lbs., but you will receive Advantage II, which has the same two active ingredients as Advantage Multi.  The only warning of the product change Entirely Pets gives is a pop-up message which may be missed or blocked.  When I asked to return the substituted product, Entirely Pets customer service promised to e-mail a mailing label, but I never received it.  If you're considering ordering directly from Entirely Pets, I recommend checking their many online customer service complaints before making a decision.
1,I have an eight year old beagle with horrible separation anxiety. I put 4 drops on a treat an hour before leaving and unfortunately, she was still stressed and barked when left alone. I tried again, giving 30 minutes before I left and she still barked. Combined a lavender collar with the drops and still no solution.
1,Neither of my dogs will eat it. Might be a good product, but if they refuse to eat it, it can't work! Maybe give it a beef or chicken flavor?
1,Pretty and it will fit in the 10Gallons tank. But the ramp won't stay with the platform, so when my turtle trying to claim on it, it falls off.
1,too thin. was torn up by my dog in no time. suggest buying a thicker one that is more sturdy.
1,My cat loved it for TWO DAYS, then the catnip smell obviously wore off! How can that be if this is "FILLED WITH CATNIP"??? Now my cat walks right past it and couldn't care less that it's there. For the price this item cost, it was a WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY!
1,Sent it back.  Not made to fit a dog!  Waste of money
1,This was the only carrier that I found that was able to accommodate my 18lb Cavapoo.  HOWEVER, with only 2 wheels, I do not like the position my dog is in.  It is difficult to maneuver and I wish there were other options.
1,Bottom of pull tabs were rusted? Anyways, Dog hates it! Gave him liguid poop every time he ate it. What a waste. Going back to Blue brand..
1,Absolutely useless. Doesn't stick to anything. Not the couch, curtains or shoe rack.a waste of money
1,My dog loves these, but after I found out that they are made in China, I will no longer be purchasing these. I have seen some other reviews that say the same thing and they make their own from dehydrated sweet potato rings. I think that's a great idea and will be giving that a try.
1,Total waste of money.  My kitten who loves toys paid no attention to this.  I threw it in the garbage.
1,Doesn't work on my cat at all. Maybe because he is long haired.
1,This is a great litter box holder and I'm not ashamed to have it where it can be visible. For looks I would give it five full stars.... BUT... there is something very wrong with the assembly materials. I bought it last fall and have used it therefore not quite a year. I am going to have to drag it out sometime very soon and take the entire thing apart and reassemble. The cam things (don't know the technical term) where you have the screw go into the metal circles just DO NOT WORK. They don't hold the screw and keep it from backing out. I showed my significant other, and he said I did it correctly. I have had SIX of them come out so far. Now  every time I open the door to scoop it, the whole thing slews over to the side and squares up again when I close the door.  We our 14-pound-cat jumps on top of it, I keep waiting for it to totally collapse. I keep using it because I am honestly not sure how to fix it. Maybe a lot of Elmer's Glue when I put the cams back in? Also, the little wooden plugs that you put in the sides to hide the holes if you don't want to use the little bar rack, those popped out the first day. I've put them back in a few times until they finally went missing. They were WAY too small to fit. Wood putty will be the answer for that.
1,Subscribe and save delivered dented cans last delivery. They were replaced when I complained with more dented cans.  I did not bother to complain second time around. It happened a few years back but all was good until now. If it keeps on happening, I'll probably cancel.  This is a premium cat/dog food and I'm paying top dollar.
1,Loved it at first until my 8 year old mutt dog tore through it after only a week. Definitely not for dogs bigger than 30ish pounds and with separation anxiety.
1,These batteries do not seem to last as long as the originals. Thankfully my dog has learned to stay in the yard and I just have the collar on without any batteries. Our dog does not notice and will not stray out of the yard.
1,I just used this for the first time on my dog after a bath and I started noticing a gross BO smell. I honestly thought maybe it was from my pits (despite how rare that is for me...ya never know). Then...I took a sniff of my clean dog and as the product was drying it began to smell like a ripe arm pit after a 10 mile run. Anyway, I rarely even write reviews but I'm also curious to hear if anyone else has this issue? It smelled ok when it first came out of the bottle but now I feel like I need to bathe Hudson again! I'm giving it 2 stars hoping that it still works to get a mat out when the time comes...if it doesn't then I'll update this review and return the product. Hope this helps at least someone!
1,Seems accurate to me		Edit started failing after only a few weeks showing 50F in room that was 77 F. Even after battery change it didn't seem to read close to the right temps
1,Did not work for my dog
1,Dig doesn't like them.
1,Item came in a hot box.  Not sure if it spoiled the food inside as my cats won't eat it.
1,My cats ate these treats twice and would not go near them after that. I also bought a bag of the CatManDoo salmon treats at the same time and they absolutely love those. We have reordered them several times.
1,The answers in the questions section are incorrect...these are "prepared in American facilities" with "quality products" but where the 'quality products' are from is not stated.  If ingredients were sourced in the US package would say so - I couldn't find that info in the description and just trusted the answered questions that say they are made in the USA.  However, if you don't mind not knowing from where the ingredients come, they look like decent treats, dense and a bit on the soft side.  On a positive note: they were delivered very quickly and on Sunday of a holiday weekend - I appreciate the speedy delivery
1,We bought this when the blue bag of Precious Cat litter wasn't available - definitely regret it. I hate when I buy clumping cat litter that doesnt clump or handle odor  it might actually make odor worse lol. I do not suggest this product.
1,The black dye on this leash is NOT sealed-hence the back transfers to EVERYTHING it touches---clothes, hands, even the dog!	VERY disappointed. Completely useless and cannot use.	Be warned- don't order the black. I heard form other buyers that there is not an issue on the brown one.
1,I must have misunderstood what I way buy but it only came with one and I thought I was paying for 3. My cat destroyed it on the first day because he's a savage but I knitted it back together and it hasn't been broken since. So cheaply made but you can adjust it and make it better.
1,Absolutely a waste of Money!!!  Wish I had believed the less than stellar reviews!  Yes, it's too hard on the gums and it made my poor dogs mouth bleed.  You are better off buying a kids soft toothbrush for $3.00 (which I did after my Vet recommended it...working like a charm) ! That's my humble opinion!! Save yourself the hassle...really!!
1,Tried two bottles, my lawn was destroyed by 60 lb female Lab Mix. Switched to Lawn Saver by Top Paw.  Much better.
1,This is the first product that I've ever seen suggest soaking your floor, leaving it sit, and then cover it WITH PLASTIC WRAP to work overnight - I have hardwood floors under the carpet. If I get the carpet too wet it's going to go right through the pad. There's no way I'm going to do this! To be quite honest we're battling pet urine stains from our cat that we had to put down - she was confused and peed in the wrong spots a few times. By the time you need something done because it smells, you might as well start from scratch and buy new carpet or rip it out and put down wood. We've had the carpet professionally cleaned twice with deodorizer, we've saturated the entire room with enzyme sprays, carpet steamed the enzyme solution DIRECTLY INTO the carpet and let it soak, etc. Save yourself time and money, save up for new carpet, and go from there - if it's cat pee, you're not getting rid of it :(
1,I purchased this to replace a broken pill gun.  The pill gets stuck in the plastic end every time instead of going into the cats mouth
1,I was looking for a treat that would keep my German Shepherds busy while I was away. I thought Quado had a neat concept with a bone that sat upright, but I fail to see the point when they chew the nub off in 10 minutes! All in all, my 8-month-old devoured this entire thing within an hour! If you are looking for something to last, instead try StarMark's Everlasting Treat Ball. That lasts my dogs a good week usually. Another good option is elk antlers. (My dogs still have one of their antlers from Christmas!)
1,A lot of fluid gravy...must be tasty for my cat but I don't like that it is so runny
1,Great in theory but they arrived with most half broken, aka useless and basically bits of odd-textured dog treats without the utility of a pill concealer. Also, they crumble when you squeeze so instead, I fill the rest with kong peanut butter stuffing. If they sent me a new bag to show that my mostly broken pack was just a fluke, Id update my review.
1,It's a nice harness for my mini dachshund, but after two months, it ripped at one of the adjustable parts so the harness does not stay connected and together.
1,I was using this product and it worked great, but for some reason this batch I received was bad I guess because it didn't work at all on my dogs.
1,I have a great dane and doberman who are constantly being attacked by flies. I used this thinking that maybe it would provide them some relief but the flies just landed on all the parts that didn't have the product. Maybe if the dogs were soaked in the product the flies would stay away but just rolling it on them didn't work. Another thing I didn't like about the product is that its dangerous for dogs to lick. Thats a problem for me since my doberman loves licking my great dane. I didn't want to risk my dogs getting sick so I stopped using the product.
1,tried it for months. Didn't work so my dog went on prozac
1,The antler was small, thin and had the sharp tip on one end.  I was very concerned about injury to my voracious Lab, during her aggressive chewing and potential breakage.  I returned the product.
1,This was a wasted purchase.  I wanted a back up collar since I have small dog & large dog this way I could swap out collars easily.  The original collar that came with the educator we cut the end since it was so long on my small breed.  I got this collar to switch out and you can't even put it on easily since it is a snap on instead of buckle you can't put it through the educator device without undoing the entire end and then trying to weave that snap piece back on and cinch it up properly it's a total inconvenience and you can buy this cheap collar anywhere for less than $5.  What a rip off!!!! It's not even made well.  Save your money!!!!!!
1,None of my four cats will eat this junk.  They only lick off the juices and the rest is left uneaten.  Even a recently adopted feral cat won't eat it.
1,Meh.	The company insisted that I leave a review, so here it is.	Like another review stated, the drawstring is about 30% down into the inside of the bag, so the inside of the bag is small.  You can cinch it up and bring the top of the inside up closer, but then the bottom of the lining comes up with it.  It just doesn't make sense.	It's well made, thus earning it 2 stars, but otherwise a waste of money.
1,Ran very small & very poor quality
1,I've had this for one month. My rabbit has chewed through the canvas side and through the velcro. Also this cage doesn't contain mess very well. I have to clean around outside the cage as well bc somehow the hay gets out. Also it's very hard to move the cage bc it's very unstable. I wish I could return it. I do like the large size and being able to take the top off.
1,It WAS a cute t-shirt for my dog, but after two washes ... it's only a grey t-shirt, with nothing on it.  It goes away.
1,I bought this bottle a few years back, set it up for my chinchillas, and didn't think much of it. The next day, I realized the bottle was still completely full. I went over to it, shook it, and both chins ran over, desperately trying to get water out of it. They were thirsty all night and I had no idea. NEVER again. Kaytee is one of the worst brands on the market overall.
1,I have bought this product direct from Halo Pets every month for 7 years but in the last 2 years the product has changed, it used to be softer and you could almost bend it in half and now it is rock solid hard (we cut it in half because I have a Shih Tzu). We bought all the flavors Pumpkin, Banana, and Mint (2 of each flavor per month) but had stopped buying the mint because it was even harder than the Pumpkin & Banana to cut much less chew.  All these treats are so hard now that my furbaby gave up on chewing it and swallowed about an 1" long piece which made him sick to the point that at midnight he was wanting to go the the bathroom every hour almost but couldn't relieve himself and when he finally did, out shot this 1" "chew" treat entirely whole!  I can't believe that made it into his system and back out, this could have turned into a vet visit or worse.  I will no longer buy these products and will not recommend these in any flavor to anyone.
1,If your dog chews up his toys, don't buy this. Our lab ate two of the sections within 5 minutes, and he was only a little over a year old at the time. Took him 3 days to poop it all out.
1,worthless, especially on a large dog.
1,fell apart and actually crumbled.  I would not give this or recommend this product for any dog.  It is not durable not do I feel it is safe.
1,I wasted my money and my time,big disappointment..after 2 weeks I got like a few strands of grass ....	Id ask for my money back if I knew who to call
1,These were purchased by accident.  They are not the kind I thought they were.  Already opened so can't return.
1,My dog's didn't like to eat it, had to heavily mask it and it didn't work.
1,I bought this in size medium for my 22 pound pug. It was really cute, but WAY too tight. The hood was too small and tight, the chest area was too tight, and the arm holes were too tight. It was also way too long; it extended past his tail. And it completely covered his underside, so if he had to go potty I would of had to pull it up every time. Sadly, I had to return it. And I'm guessing a large, would fit better, but then would be too long if the medium went past his tail, so I'm on the hunt for a new brand now.
1,Did not like.  Great concept but didn't do well for us.  The screen would not stay in place and caused a mess.  Litter would come out of side slightly too when flipping the box upside down.
1,Love the ease of doing  water changes this way...but...there must be a design or quality issue here. I have got two of these and they have both cracked on the same place. After the first one, I was very careful..	And still happened. I tried to fix...but water still sprays out during use. I cover with a towel to stop it from spraying everywhere! Hover this crack has clearly impacted the suction as well.
1,I dropped it and broke it with in 10 minutes of opening the box.  I am sure it will work, but it is very fragile.
1,I can't get them to let me even put it in their mouths.
1,Both cats threw it up consistently
1,I have bought at least 11 of these over the last 8 years and all of them eventually go bad in just over a year.  What happens is that the battery will go dead then you put a new one in, only to find out that the circuit board is junk.  Every one of them and Tri tronics will not stand behind them.  They make you pay $60 for a new one with a 60 day warranty.  I'm tired and switching brands.
1,These don't fit the Drinkwell Platinum as they should - way too loose.
1,I have both Tetra and an Aqueon 55 gallon aquariums.  This screen cover did not fit either tank.  Why?  The hinge in the center of the cover is too narrow and does not fit over the center support span on either brand of tank.  This results in the screen cover not being able to lay down on the tank top in place.  Too bad they did not think of this problem and make a flat rubber style hinge for this cover instead of metal hinges that don't fit!!!!!!
1,Kong makes a far superior product.  To be fair, my dog likes the smell of these more than the Kong version, but these to not stand up well at all.  My dog is not very destructive herself, but frequently wrestles her toys out of the mouths of other dogs at the park.  These Squeakinator balls get destroyed after just one or two sessions of such play.  The Kong version gets destroyed as well, of course, but seems to last more than twice as long.
1,These did not turn out to be a hit any of my 3 cats.  One of my cats is actually afraid of them.
1,The description said it fits all models except the 360.  That's just irritating as hell to wait so long and then they don't fit.  Not even close.
1,Well... read and learn (I should have). It broke in 10 minutes. The top 'paw' is very poor in craftsmanship and when the post was being tightened the top became loose. When little 2.6 lb Whiskey jumped on his new toy... it snapped off.	My husband used tons is Liquid Nail All Purpose Adhesive. We'll see how long it lasts.	Poor baby--- he really loves his new little jungle gym.
1,I have bought this for years and somtime about 8 months back they changed the bag design and something formula,  vey dusty and doesnt seem to be as odor controlling. Hard to find the other one now but I still prefer it.
1,I just received this little toy. It is so adorable I seriously would like to buy another one. I'm not sure if mine was made poorly but my 10 pound chihuahua seriously destroyed it in 5minutes!! Usually she takes longer with other toys but this one she destroyed took all the fluff out and left it on the floor dead. In FIVE MINUTES!!!! Very disappointing
1,Did not fit well
1,it works for my dog, he immediatly stops what hes doing and walks away when the sounds goes off... this machine just doesnt work as it should.		the unit doesnt go off from noise, it just goes off if I tap on it or open it and move the switches, not when he barks.  Even if it went off for all noises, that would be fine by me but the fact that it doesnt care about anything thats not directly on it. Maybe mine just has a poor microphone or something so it doesnt trigger correctly. The fact that it plugs in instead of having to change the batteries every few days was a major plus, the fact that it doesnt actually work was a waste of almost $40 though :(
1,My two 30-lb young dogs practically cackled as they scrambled merrily over this barrier to the front seat. Not for determined dogs.
1,My cats did not like these. Made one of my cats even throw up!  We'll stick with the Chicken ones as both of my cats LOVE LOVE LOVE those!
1,Thought this would look nicer in my Betta tank, but the sand it so fine. My fish died and so I went and got another, and  he also dies. I put gravel back and the next fish is still alive and well.
1,These caps are very difficult, because of their stiffness, to put on the smaller sized cat food cans.  Though they can fit, the effort exceeds the reward so we put them in the trash.
1,Should have paid more attention to prior reviews.  This item is so cheap it started to disintegrate after 6 passes through it with my small Lab.  I know, I know, it was very inexpensive - just thought it'd last a bit longer.
1,Update after six days.  Took this down to one star.  You are not getting a potted plant but a selection of bare root plant which is what I understood when purchasing. A number of the plants appeared sickly but seem to be still alive.  All the leaf tips on the Anubias were broken off and the broken pieces weren't in the bag leading to believe it was in this condition when sent. You can see this in the pictures of my review. It does not look like I received the five stems of Bacopa monnierii.  I cannot identify what I did receive but their condition was not good nor did the leaves look like Bacopa monnierii.  If you look at the picture I uploaded the stems I received at the bottom do not match up to the ad's pics and descriptions(they are to the right of what I assume is the Amazon Sword).  The leaf has a serated edge. There are several individual leafs that came off above the stems. If anyone can tell me what they are I would appreciate it. The Java Ferns all looked good.  The frogbit died. The egeria densa looked poor and has since melted completely.  Overall I was hoping for healthier looking plants.  For the price it is not worth it.  I spent $25 total(including shipping).  I would have done better and gone to a fish store and paid $40 plus.
1,Had no effect on my cats itching.
1,These don't work. I gave more than stated amount and nothing.
1,Bought for my rabbit. As a former vet technician I wouldn't recommend these for any one. They aren't sharp and awkward to handle
1,A bit steep, so far 1/6 dogs uses it, gravel for grip doesn't help wish it was carpet
1,The large will only fit a very small dog' less than 30 pounds. Very misleading. A small might be approipriate for a hamster.
1,Smell is VERY strong. If you are sensitive to smells don't buy it for use on your pets,or inside the house
1,Not what I was expecting. It looked like pt. Not very appetizing but it was for my dog, not me. I put it in my dogs bowl, he gave it a sniff, turned his nose up at it and walked away. Wouldn't eat it. Sad because Blue Buffalo is such an outstanding brand.	I donated the remainder to our local veterinary hospital.
1,We had such high hopes.  The reviews were awesome.  Unfortunately, it just didn't stand up to the jaws of a maniac Goldendoodle.  We took it away during the day when we aren't home, and only gave it to him when we could supervise him.  He absolutely loved it...loved it to death.  He's very good with his hands, er paws, and he was able to unwind the ends quickly.  After that it was a cinch to pick it all apart.  Sigh.  We'd love to find a good twisted, knotted toy that would last at least a month!  It's not this one for us :(
1,2 years old and it failed and overheated the tank killing all my fish!
1,This stuff was so bad could not use it.it was awful stunk so bad could not stand it was not what I thought it was threwvit in the trash.would not buy this again a waste of money.
1,Conceptually, I think this is a great dog toy and has the potential to regulate the rate at which your dog eats. The idea is that you fill the top with food or treats and the dog pushes down on the blue tray. The toy then distributes a random amount of food.	The only problem, and this may be just my dogs, is that they just weren't interested in putting forth the effort. It didn't matter what I put in the dispenser for either of them. Neither of my dogs wanted to play with it.	So while I think it's a great concept, I think it's important to know your pet's personality and judge the likelihood that they will engage with the toy. In our case it just didn't work.
1,We bought a pair of these beds for our small dog crates. The dogs barely use them, but one did get barfed on. We tossed the cover in the wash and it came out with a broken zipper. We are not happy.
1,As a user of Natural Balance Small Breed dog food for over a decade we have had to switch . After a trip to the vet we have traced our dogs inability to keep his food down to the food. The negative reviews of others having this problem - stale mood and new formula - seems to have been the problem. Sorry this had to hppen since our dogs have been totally health using NB over the years
1,After 5 minutes of this being on my tank the front layer started to peel off. I purchased a thermometer that goes inside the tank and the two temps do not match up. I would not recommend using this product if you want a reliable temperature- which can be paramount in keeping your fish happy and safe.
1,Both my small dogs reacted big time with the small dog dose ( papillon, & chih-IG mix). They both lost most of their fur, itched every second of the day, and gave their skin sensitive rashes and they were so uncomfortable for more than 2 months after applying it. I applied it July 10th 2014 and their fur is finally growing back now, but my papillon still has minor scabs that are still healing. This was my first flea tick med for them ever cuz never needed it till I moved to Dallas. After this reaction I'm not looking forward to trying anything else cuz I don't ever want my dogs to suffer like that again. I wanted to try Vectra 3d but have read plenty of reviews of bad reactions too and frontline is very similar to pet armor. What am I to do? Use nothing? Does anyone have any suggestions that are "natural" or much safer?
1,I'll never use this on my cat. She is way too small for either supplied collar.
1,This product bubbles nice but will not stay in the gravel which is more than 2 inches deep I had to buy suction cups to keep it in place, I would not buy this again I would get the one that has suction cups and it was a lower price.
1,fine
1,My dog chewed then started digesting the nylon body as she chewed and I worry about how really safe this PetSafe product is for any canine.
1,Too many cons:	1- I own one of these. And although it's a good concept, it's far too light weight and flimsy to be of any use. Even for an 8 week old male Syrian teddy bear hamster.	2- I had to anchor the base of the saucer to the lid of my hamsters wire cage in order for him to use it. And he does, and he loves it, additionally to running on it out in the open, but it's very unbalanced when in use, and does get flipped over if it's not anchored down some how.	3- I also have to add veggie oil to the turning mechanism in the base that the saucer simply slips over ...so that the saucer part rotates smoothly. It doesn't squeak, it just gets stuck. So, adding the oil works.	4- The base is just a softer pliable light weight plastic, and is hollow. It supports the saucer, but doesn't keep the saucer upright. Some saucers are big enough for Degus, Rats and Chinchillas, but these animals can't use it. They'll just flip it over when they sit on it, or they'll kick it across the cage unintentionally the second they try to run on it. *A ferret, even a baby ferret will crack or just break the actual saucer, not to mention none of these saucers are big enough for even young ferrets.	5- It's made of a pretty fragile plastic. My saucer section CRACKED as I was talking the paper label off of it. And I was being careful.		Pro: In my opinion, this is the only size that can suit a hamster at any age. Only mice can use the smaller ones.		Conclusion: This product simply isn't worth your time or money.
1,My white pitbull terrier started having head tremors/bobbing after giving her this supplement. She is healthy and active and young. She has allergies to many dog foods and I feed her Zignature, but I don't have her on supplements or liquid flea/tick preventative. Nor does she take any other medications at the present. She has a flea/tick collar that works phenomenally for her. She is on day two of receiving glucosamine and today she had an episode of head bobbing, side to side. Not a seizure, she was awake. I did some research and I'm thinking the glucosamine isn't agreeing with her and caused her to have the tremors. Is anyone else having this problem?
1,Looks real nice but dog chewed the tabs off within minutes
1,I've been buying JW toys for my dog for as long as she's been here.  Almost all of them are great.		This one, lasted 10 minutes.  It's a toy made to be chewed on, but it can't stand up to 10 minutes of chewing.  Their other toys are great, but this one is a waste of money.
1,I bought this product knowing it would be a hit or miss with my dog, as many of these behavioral remedies are. My chow chow has severe separation anxiety. I was open to trying everything and I still am. Unfortunately, this did not help or hurt, even combined with the prozac and other herbal remedies.
1,I want to give you the most info so you make an educated buy. My dog is 32 lbs. she laid on this bed for maybe 5 hours total over the first 2 days. It is easy to tell where she laid because all the padding is smushed and basically leaves her laying on the floor. It's not good. At all. Not worth the 50 I paid. I was happier with a bed I bought at marshals. Unfortunately, my other dog ate that one:(
1,Cats have not clue what to do with it.
1,This product did NOT work: sometimes it would send the signal, sometimes it would not. It was completely counter productive to our dog's training because sometimes we would give her a command followed by vibration.. little did we know that that vibration was only working 1/2 the time. So we then upped it to shock mode, and the same thing: sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't - completely confusing the dog. This product is UNRELIABLE and NOT RECOMMENDED! DO NOT BUY! Please get in touch to discuss a refund. Thanks.
1,straps ripped within second week of use ,not fit for big or strong dogs ,I have a year old pitbull he doesn't weight more then 50 lb I can literally pick him up with one hand ,but in just the second week of use the straps ripped apart at the grommets ,
1,Terrible cheap harness. Does not fit as described. Very cheaply made.
1,to bulky
1,Bought 2 of these. Tested them to see how far they were off before using them. 1 was off by 2.2 degrees. The other was of by 3.4 degrees. I tested these against a calibrated thermometer with an acurracy of +/- .1 degree. If you need to be within 5 degrees these may not work for you.
1,first of all, i shouldn't have bought this.  it's too big for cat kibble.  the kibble would be stale before they could finish it.  this probably works for dogs who eat more than 7 lb cats.  besides my error, the quality of the feeder is poor.  Flimsy materiels, the white body doesn't screw in securely to the black base.  then the black top doesn't screw in very well either.  overall, even if it were cat-sized, it would have been a poor buy.
1,I'm currently giving my cat a lysine paste from the vet. Since getting the paste into her mouth is quite an ordeal, I decided to try these treats instead. Unfortunately I've tried to give her the treats 3 different times and every time she has thrown up - so I know  it's from these . I'm very disappointed. I'm guessing that there's some additive that she has an issue with since I know it's not the lysine.	***Update 3/23/14*******	I decided to try these again. I've given her a half of a piece for a few days and then increased it to a whole treat (broken in half though)and no vomiting. I've done this for a week now and she's only dry heaved (with clear liquid expelled) once this week.
1,Was o.k. while it worked, but died after 4 months of use in a 5 gal. betta tank. Poor betta was freezing his butt off until I realized it...
1,I bought this on the recommendation of a pet store. My puppy has some itching and developed two small hot spots. Wanted a gentle shampoo to help with his itching until the oral medication helps him, and something to use long/ term. The first time I washed him with it, I thought I hadn't rinsed it well enough or something.	His fur seemed limo after a day and he still has a stinky dog smell that you can smell 5 feet away (other shampoos left him smelling good)	The next time, I left it on for five minutes , and rinsed it meticulously. That was yesterday morning and he looks unkept, oily and is very smelly. Going to try something else!
1,Gave both my cats diahrea. Vet tomorrow. Hope they will be ok. Please dpn't buy this for your kittens/cats.
1,doesn't fit my RX350
1,Received the wrong flavor and my dog has zero interest in this. She loves NylaBones but not this one.
1,I shopped around a little after purchasing this antler chew, and I really don't think this one was a good deal. It is about 6 inches long, as advertised, but pretty thin. Also my dog, who usually goes crazy for elk antlers, isn't really interested in chewing it. I recommend ordering from Grateful Shed Antler Chews instead.
1,My dogs didn't care for this product. So, I was left with a bunch.... I put them in my doggies' food so they wouldn't notice.
1,Tiny. Dog ate it in a few seconds
1,My dwarf chewed one of them and have never touch the rest ever since... I don't know what to do with the rest now
1,I'm really disappointed in this cage.	For $80.00 I expected something a little more heavy duty.	It is a nice big cage and I would love the seed catcher and how the bottom is set up, but the wiring for the cage is a joke.  Very flimsy.  I don't see this cage lasting for any amount of time.  And to be honest there was no way I was going to let my cockatiel in there, because the door and top parts to snap together quite right his weight of less than a pound would make the cage sides move, and I'm positive he would get his feet stuck in between and cut.	I'm going to send it back and keep looking for something more sturdy, this is just disappointing.
1,It's still cricket food, but its half the normal size, I thought it was wider than the normal. It works ok if you don't have a lot of crickets... But is very expensive.
1,doesn't work on my dog.
1,My Sugar Glider did not like these at all.
1,Not small. Seems to be more on the medium side.
1,I gave 2 of these to my 7 lb puppy within about 1 hour and within another 30 minutes she threw up.  I think they are too dry for a small dog, and it took quite a bit of chewing for her to eat one fairly small piece... I even broke a smaller chunk off the second time.		I'm sure they are healthier than some other treats, but I will give to my daughter for her much larger dogs.
1,This cage is being marketed as a "bird" cage. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS AS A CAGE FOR ANY BIRD. This cage is absolutely inappropriate for birds. It's size is barely appropriate for small birds like finches but the bar spacing is sized for a large parrot. Imagine living in a small half bathroom. That's what putting a parrot in this tiny cage is like. And PLEASE *NEVER* use aluminum foil (as another reviewer mentioned) to line any cage - even with papers on top. Birds can easily chew through papers and get to the foil. Ingesting foil can cause damage to their digestive system as well as toxicity. As a decoration for a home or a wedding, it is very pretty but it is NOT a suitable cage for any bird!
1,bought three months twice and it never worked at all  waste of money
1,When I purchased this item, it did not say mini.  I now see that the description is changed.  If your looking for a true "mini" sized toy, this is it.  The toy is less than the size of a dollar bill.
1,This pet gate is flimsy, due to the inadequate hinges. The first hinge was broken (bent) when I removed the gate from the box. Within less than a day, the second hinge also bent and broke. The gate itself is cute but the poor hinges ruin it. I cannot recommend this gate.
1,Like paper...
1,I can't believe that I am waiting over two weeks for cat litter. Then, I read the fine print---it is being shipped from CHINA. There's a sucker born every minute and I am one!
1,I haven't used this product yet but I know people who have, and if the dog handler has an understanding of how to use the product, is humane and also provides encouragement and praise, it's a good tool.		My issue is the delivery was late, after Christmas and it was a gift.		I am returning it.		Now that timing isn't an issue I found the collar on "Gun Dogs Online" .com.  Free shipping, free holster.  Currently they have a $20 coupon bringing the price down to $219.  The product without the coupon is $239.00.		It includes a free holster.  The holster through Amazon is $19.00 plus $3.99 shipping.		Overall you save $43.00.		I am a fan of Amazon and it's very rare that they're delivery is late or that I find a better price with another company.		Gun Dogs Online had excellent customer service too.
1,Looked like vomit and my cat wouldn't touch it.  Would not purchase again.
1,dogs were scared and you need 2 people to use it
1,Not really sure if these do anything.  The dogs won't eat them alone we have to put some type of food like peanut butter or something on them to even get the dogs to eat em.  Don't waste your money
1,I have no idea why the reviews are so high. These are very flimsy and use about a third of the plastic as the heavy duty kind. As a result, they lost their shape and ability to 'snap' onto a can. Also, you can buy a heavy duty ones from wal-mart for 1 dollar a piece, making these slightly overpriced. I highly regret buying these.
1,Fell apart, rusted...
1,I returned the crate the day after I received it.  It had a loose part inside and smelled awful.  Also, I had trouble with the  sides collapsing.  I did like the fact that it fit in my car, but I wouldn't put any animal in it due to the smell.
1,Poor design. My dog hated to wear it as it would almost decapitate him when it was time to remove.
1,Horrid. My german shepherd ripped these right out of the everlasting bento ball things. Never had that problem with the earlier one we bought.
1,It's not all it's cracked up to be. I would not buy it again. I've been working on urine spots in my house from a child with a disability potty training. Which by the way - she finally is going in the pity ...and big brag for her!!!	I thought with the other reviews and It being a Clorox product I had finally found the solution!! Wrong. And it wasn't my treatment of the spots- the product is not up to all it says it does. I've been at this rodeo a LONG time.		I wish I could get my money back - I even bough 4 because I was enchanted and hopeful. I am still looking BTW.	It also leaves behind a chemical sort of smell- mixed with urine makes for an unhappy me!!!		Would like to make give it one star. But maybe it works for some.
1,I was very suprised that the product comes from Thailand . I wonder where the actual ingredient	comes from  China?  Very disappointed will not buy again. Expected more from Rachael !
1,poor quality
1,I bought this for my 60# pitt just becaue I wanted the longer leash. But did not take in account the messurements of it and once I received it I realized just how HUGE this thing is! It was very very akward just to hold. I think it may have been made for a horse... =)
1,Good size for small togs; squeaker died quickly.
1,I had previously purchased a store brand probiotic tablet that was strawberry flavored for my dogs. They loved them.	They do not like this brand, and spit them out, even wrapped in lunchmeat.	Chewable maybe but my dogs don't like them.
1,My dog really doesn't care to play with this toy
1,My husband put this on a pee spot and the carpet turned yellow after we cleaned it up. Yuck!
1,This is a knock-off of better-made alternatives. This one is cheaply made - an okay purchase if you plan to use for a short period and then discard. But, for longer term use, this one will not hold up over time.
1,Mine were not sharp and one of the black grips keeps sliding off.  :(  The master tool strippers that I have used have been great quality, so was surprised when this clipper did not cut cleanly.
1,Everything about this thing feels cheap. Nothing broke, but every piece just falls apart holding this thing. The reflector just comes off with no effort. Both ends of this thing just falls off once again with no effort. If it was $15 ok then. But $40 and this thing doesn't even come with any decent mounting options. Just 2 zip ties.  I'm very disappointed with the quality of this thing. I guess it's because it's the newest type of uvb that's out there, they can over charge for this piece of junk. If there were more options out there I would return this thing.
1,Every time I feed him this food, my kitty throws up in the middle of the night
1,I recently adopted a new cat and had hoped this product would help him with adjusting to his new home.  It didn't seem to help him in any way whatsoever.  I mixed a few drops into his wet food and also added a few drops into his water.  I did the same with my other two cats since this was also a change for them.  All of my cats ate their food; however, didn't like their water.  I won't buy this again.
1,I did not like this trimmer at all!!  It did not even work long enough to clean the face and feet of one of my very small poodles and the puppy did not have alot of hair to cut!
1,I was purchasing because is a cheap low-carb food for my diabetic cat. I recently found out its maker, Purina, utilizes animal testing for its products. I will never purchase again.
1,Dog loves it,  but unfortunately the company was bought out by Purina,  and not all ingredients are sourced in the USA.
1,Too bulky as a backpack.  I could wheel it around like luggage.  I guess it depends on what you want it for.
1,To hard for my Standard Poodle and Yorkie. Started coughing.
1,I don't know if it works or not, couldn't get my cats to take it.  They could tell it was in the food, the little suckers!
1,Way too small for my german shepherd's chest
1,The ball is made from very hard plastic.
1,I liked this heater when it was working it did its job. The the things i didn't like were it needed water to be passing by for it to be heating well and after 4 years it stopped working
1,The cats loved this but after only about a month the pump went out and it was no good any more. My mother had also bought one for her cat and hers only lasted two weeks.	Update 5/14	My mother bought another one to give it another try. She is using distilled water. It seems to work better. Our water isn't that hard so if you use one of these and want it to last make sure it's quality water and keep it topped off. If it gets to low it burns out. Her one cat can't drink enough a day to need to check it daily. Hope this helps.
1,We tried this on our cats when the got fleas from the dog.  We had to soak the cats in order to see any results but I think we drowned the fleas instead of this product actually working.
1,Item was not sturdy.  Plastic broke and cracked before use.
1,Someone gave this as a gift to my dog. The idea of it is great, but it doesn't really work well. You're supposed to screw the two halves together and depending on how "tightly" they are, the crack between them adjusts to allow different sized treats to fall out. The problem is often-times, it's either too tight or too loose, meaning the treats either don't fall out at all or all fall out within 5 seconds. I haven't used it much because of this, since my dog either gets frustrated because nothing ever comes out or eats all the treats quickly.
1,My cat was able to lick past it.... She doesn't even have that big of a head....
1,Didn't last a day. Arrived yesterday and I started using it today in my dogs crate. I come home from work during lunch and the mesh part already ripped. Item description says up to 100 lbs and my dog is 55 lbs. Bummed cause this fit in her crate perfectly.
1,Feathers came out the first 5 minutes my cats played with them
1,This food causes foul-smelling diarrhea in one of my cats and poorer quality stool in the other. The ingredient I find to be causal, based on feeding tests, is tapioca starch and potato. Tapioca starch and potato are both carbohydrates. Cats often do not digest carbohydrates well, as cats have shorter digestive tracts and are obligate carnivores. What is likely happening in my very sensitive cat is osmotic diarrhea and carbohydrate malabsorption. After eliminating foods with potato starch and tapioca, she has started to regain weight lost from her bout with diarrhea (took me awhile to figure it out via feeding tests).		Cats with IBD often achieve remission via dietary elimination of grains AND other carbohydrate sources. What cat in the wild would eat tapioca or a potato?		Wysong, a pet food manufacturer, has taken a strong stance against tapioca. They say it is a "poor substitute for grains," high in sugar, and also associated with toxins. They say that pet food manufacturers often tout "no grain" to "imply that the grains have been replaced by a superior ingredient" when Wysong goes on to say they have not. Note: I don't feed Wysong food to my cats as they include things like corn and rice in their canned food options. (I do not feed kibble as it is problematic in cats with IBD --and usually contains excessive carbohydrates that are needed for kibble to hold its shape.)		From the reviews, it's obvious that many cats tolerate this food. I do think one should consider long-term impact of carbohydrates in terms of raising IBD and diabetes risk. Both diseases are on the rise in pet cats. When considering cat anatomy and many of the foods cats eat, how can we be surprised?		This food is formulated (as are most pet foods) to meet nutritional guidelines set by the AAFCO. Many pet owners are surprised to learn that clinical studies are not done with most pet foods. --They are just formulated. It's less costly.		This food, like many today, is made in Thailand.		I think the manufacturer should consider foods like TikiCat that are similar and made without a gravy --rather a broth. No need for tapioca or potato starch to make a broth.
1,The elastic stretched out very quickly. Had to add air daily. Dog was still able to reach his hip to lick his wound. Disappointed
1,Our puppy ripped this apart in just a matter of days. It needs to be more sturdy.
1,I ordered the jumbo size, it's not enough room for my medium sized pitbull and she sinks to the ground because there isn't enough support.	For $28 at Costco/walmart you can get a large dog bed that's bigger and much thicker.
1,I put peanut butter into the hollow part to even get them to pay it any attention, but they didn't seem to like the texture. They acted spooked about it, didn't want to be around it long.
1,Good while it lasted.  After washing it a couple of times, the stuffing inside the mattress got all messed up.
1,I purchased this leash based on the good reviews. I have a 6 pound Chihuahua and this leash is rated for a 26lb dog. It snapped within two months from purchase with normal use. I would not buy this product again. I may try the retractable tape version for much larger dogs to see if it's any better. I contacted the company and I'm waiting for a reply to see if they will stand behind their product.
1,First application of this on my 15 year old cat ended up with a visit to the vet with a skin infection.  She had a bad reaction to this flea and tick preventative and had to go on antibiotics to clear the problem .  Have used other similar products with no problem.
1,My 3 cats LOVED Iams food, but suddenly all 3 stopped eating it.  I can only guess that maybe the formula changed?  Perhaps not, but they stopped eating it.  I went to Pro Plan Urinary Tract formula, they LOVE it can bug me even more at feeding time for the wet food, even though they have dry food available 24/7!!!  Might not be Iams' fault, but I did find it odd that all 3 cats' taste would change simultaneously.
1,ORIGINALLY I GAVE THIS 5 STARS, BUT AFTER 2 MONTHS, ALL THE PRINT RUBBED OFF, & ALL HAND WASHED WITH DISH WATER SOAP
1,Got this to go with the Petmate Dogloo XT Giant, thinking that it would fit and sadly it does not. I waited too long to return it, and now it just takes up space in the closet. May resell. I might have been able to look at dimensions for the opening to see if it would fit, but I went by the title of the two items and assumed. Should probably rename it something else so others don't get confused as well.
1,Has caused me nothing but trouble and the loss of a fish. I bought this filter for a 30 gallon gold fish tank, as what I thought would be an upgrade. With-in a month both of my large gold fish had ick, which eventually killed one of them. Since then I test my water very frequently and have found that even with a 50 percent water change I can not keep the nitrates at a safe level.	The manufacture suggested that I change the filter media once a week, and do a 50 percent water change at the same time.		I do not have the time or money for this filter. Will not be purchasing another Marineland product.
1,First you have to fill it with water. Instructions say you must put in EXACTLY how much water they say, so you can't just put a hose in. So it takes time because you're measuring each cup. Plus, holding it up as it gets heavier. Then you lay it out so that the gel is evenly distributed. Came home the first day and slipped in this clear goo all over the floor. Dog bit a hole in it. My God, what a mess!
1,The WORST cat food I ever purchased!  It is very messy.  Cannot avoid spilling or getting on hands when opening. Cats REFUSE to eat it.  Never, never will I purchase a product this again.
1,I ordered it for my pug . I ordered a medium which should fit just fine. Could barely get it over his head without forcing it. I have returned it, just mailed it the other day. When the transaction (exchange ) is complete I will come back and let everyone know how it goes and give a true rating on product and seller
1,Tiny
1,Not very vibrant and a pain in the but to install. This is harder than trying to get all the bubbles out of a screen protector on a phone. The grid lines are hard to see to know where to cut. The only positive is it did get my fish more active once installed.
1,less than 5 minutes after it came ....the handle was chewed off... this is not sturdy at all....now it also will not float as advertised because there is a hole where the handle was.  It arrived today and is worth nothing already.  What a waste of over $10 ... way overpriced for a piece of crud.  I am going back to the kong and jolly ball that is tougher and made better not some knock off that is made poorly and costs way too much.
1,I don't know about you but I will not feed my dog 'food' from China.  Smokehouse products ARE made in China so buyer beware.
1,I wouldn't give this any stars but you have to to write the review.  It was very very strong and took days to be able to put them on my dogs without affecting theirs breathing and my breathing.  Once the smell weakened, I put them on my dogs before we went out and they always came in with a few fleas on them.  Everytime they came in, I had to comb them with the flea collar to get the fleas off before they had time to bite my dogs.  These were definitely a waste of money and I have two extras that I would love to return as they don't work.  A few drops of geranium essential oil along with a few drops of lavender essential oil mixed in a spray bottle with water worked  better than these collars.  I am truly disappointed.  I was hoping to find a collar that I could leave on all the time with natural products that would work, so I didn't have to spray them all the time.  It's not this one.
1,This product was not what I expected. And I returned it.
1,Won't feed to my cats - has GMO's
1,On the picture they show you a big bottle I got what you see on the left small bottle only
1,These smell so bad we decided throw them away.  We tried boiling them outside, rinsing with baking soda and vinegar and they still smelled so bad you would think the septic system is backing up on someone in the neighborhood. Waste of money and hooves.
1,I had this running in my new tank for a week before it stopped working. I took it apart, put it back in after a few days and it starting running again but stopped AGAIN. My Betta is now sick and it would be really nice to have a working filter. Im really disappointed that I wasted my money on this filter since Im going to have to go out and buy a new one now for my sick fish. Two thumbs down!!
1,Arrived not working.
1,Disappointed. My cat was not at all interested in it.
1,to small
1,Good price on the mealworms but when mine arrived half of them were dead and black and had a horrible rotting smell that stinks to high heaven.
1,We got this for two house cats for settling into a new house. With thought it might make for less trauma after a huge change and 200 mile move.		Unfortunately, it didn't help. In many ways, I think it agitated them more.  The two cats are fighting more (they were buds before).  I didn't install it for a week so the first week was kitty-xanax free and they were better than when we plugged these in. I tried the second week with two instead of one, thinking maybe I didn't get enough in the air.		Didn't matter, they weren't happy. I removed both this morning and already they are getting along better. Perhaps with male spraying it may help, but these cats didn't see benefits.
1,I read all reviews seems most of the people are satisfied with it, so I decide to give it a try!	First, I like the way it reads, is very easy and straight forward, colorize.	But, when I compare to my big in-tank professional thermometer, I found the reads is 5 degree high than the actual! that's total unacceptable, if it's only 1 or 2 degree, it's ok, but 5 is too much!	Not recommended at all!
1,Cat totally ignores this and the dry catnip. No interest in the product
1,Had to return, quit working soon after install.
1,If you have small fish then you would like this item. However, for my Daughter's Male Betta named Astro This thing is way smaller than I expected to be (My bad for not reading all of the description) it seems like it's only a 2.99 product with extra 4 dollars for hand painted. If I saw this on a shelf at the store I would have put it back down.
1,This product did not come with any instructions. Also, the charger adapter does not seem to work. I can only charge it with the usb in a usb port. Both the collar and the remote need to be charged for 6 hours before initial use, but since it only comes with one charger, it takes 12 hours before you can even try it. The instructions for charging the collar do not say anything about dissassembling it in order to find the charger port either. There are other parts in the box, but no explanation as to what to do with them. I am very disappointed in the product because I can't use it without proper instructions. I'm not interested in trying it out on my dog in order to see how it works. That wouldn't exactly be fair. I am returning this item asap.
1,Piece of plastic junk.  Cats hate it.
1,This product has not worked, dog is still shedding as bad as ever.
1,Update: We bought this bed 3 years ago and my dog has barely used it. We kept it in a cool room. Today I decided to wash the cover and I found it messed up from the inside. I am sad because he was finally using it. When we first bought it he only used it 1 week and then I got him a smaller one for his crate. My puppy has another one which she uses every day, I just hope it doesnt get ruined like this one.		Old review: My beautiful cocker spaniel is almost 11 years old. He is my baby and I love to spoil him (he deserves everything)! Unfortunately he suffers from back pain due to his arthritis and I've noticed that as the weeks pass he has more pain! I bought him this bed because I want him to be comfortable. So far he has used it 3 days and seems to really like it, he might even love it but I think he still loves his old one because that one was huge and the size of this one is exact for him without extra space so that is something we are not happy with, we wish it was bigger so we give it a 4 star but we do recommend it for smaller dogs or if your dog doesn't need the extra space. It is very cute and I love the material!
1,I have a cat that the only fish he likes is shrimp.  Only shrimp.  So I bought the flakey cans of  shrimp for him.
1,I bought two of these. They're were very easy for my dog to break inside and pull all the foam out.  Didn't last 3 days.  My dog is 7 years old and past the chewing stage. Hardly has any teeth. So I'm stuck with my extra one and not sure what I'll do with it
1,did not work and never heard back from the sellerWould never buy from that seller no return communiations from seller
1,Don't waste your money.
1,Kitty loved this toy for about a day and a half. After than, she would go over and sniff, but walk away. I really do not think this toy is actually filled with 100% cat nip. In the garbage it goes. My cats love cat nip but I find that most cat nip filled toys are less than 100%. I actually worry about what the majority of stuffing is in this think
1,Used it as per instructions and it killed my fish. Not only in one tank but in 2. Not only one time but twice! No good!
1,I did not purchase her, bought at a local pet food store. I wanted to switch to these from greenies as I think greenies are making her gain weight. Since their website doesnt have a place for ratings I will try here! I let my girl sample 1... several hours later its made her sick. She has diarrhea, is butt scooting, and eating grass to try to ease her tummy. She also let out a loud fart something she never does. Pet owners be warned... if your pup has a sensitive tummy this is not the right dental chew! I feel awful for having let her try it!!!
1,I have tried four different collars and only one made any difference. Hint, cheap starts with a Z.
1,Dog would not wear it.  I'll fitting.
1,I purchased this in October. I clean this every week and a half and it is already broken. No idea how this happened... Don't waste your money... I will try a cheaper one only because my cat does like this a lot...
1,It was not clear that this is not one piece. It is NOT. I am disappointed that this is several pieces. I would have preferred if this was a molded piece. Cleaning is not easy. It said it was dishwasher safe, no way it can be.
1,I have used two bottles of this and have been using for two months.  It does not seem to help with the stains around my dogs eyes.  I really was hoping it would work, but no luck
1,My Rottweiler puppy destroyed this in less than 15 min. What a mess, but she was certainly having fun spreading it all over the house.		For a miniture dog maybe, big dog? Save your money.
1,I bought these. they do not work. I could have bought a $1 pair to do kids crafts that would work better. they don't handle well. just chews at the hair. nice packaging but they don't work. I bought a 9" 'Laazar' shears at the same time that does a decent job.
1,This is only one of two wet dog foods that I've found that my multi-item allergic dog can eat, and the lower priced one since it's mid-line while the other is a specialty brand, thus double the cost. I've been ordering it for about a year, but the price has jumped by $4 a case and the selection of flavors has declined. Now it's less for me to go to my local chain pet store - even adding in the state sales tax. Not great for my back. *sigh*
1,I won't be buying these again. They are 1/4 of an inch consistently, and those that can attempt to say they are 1/2" are very hollow. I have a corgi mix (so a small-medium size dog, and it's gone in less than two minutes (her Virbac VeggieDent lasts at least 5 minutes).		She enjoys these (she is a dog after all) and they are from great ingredients. But these are more for quick treats than anything else. I am very disappointed in this purchase, especially considering the price I paid.
1,my dog got out of it in a few hours and completely destroyed it
1,Product probably does what it is supposed to do but wasn't my cats issue. I purchased hoping it would help IBS in my cat but found I had to change her food entirely and add lysine to her daily diet to clear up her condition. Not the manufacturers fault as Purina makes great products.
1,Even though it takes me a good 10 minutes and a screwdriver to get the cookie into this toy, my dog will still get it out fairly quickly. I don't know how she does it. I wish it lasted longer.
1,My dogs never cared for it one way or another. Even when I put it in the fridge, they had no interest, but it seems durable. I've stepped on it plenty of times and no leaks yet!
1,It didn't work in our car
1,Terrible quality! Absolutely dissapointed, and upset I paid for such a terrible product! Not a happy customer!
1,This appeared to be very old and stale. Even my outdoor cats wouldn't eat it.
1,You get what you pay for. The base on this is so tiny that it immediately tips over. If you use it for anything, I would recommend kittens only and then you'll want to bolt it to a wall. Even with small cats the shelf position is awkward for them to climb. I should have read the reviews first as many of them said the same thing. I had it for 2 days and then donated it to a local rescue with some instructions to make it work. If they don't bolt it to the wall, they would want to have a handy person build a bigger base for it, but it must be secured.
1,This is not as good as another model I purchased. The vibration feature was always enough for me to use but even that is less than ideal. The charging function is annoying as you need to lift the collar and then a rubber protectant flap which is annoying. I was just disappointed on the range and functionality. I like the remote, but it just seems to fail to work even while its on the counter and I am trying to test it.
1,Returned it. Doesn't work as expected.
1,My indoor cat, Snowy got a few fleas on her recently, so I went to Petsmart and bought this product. Not good. About an hour after I put it in the back of her neck, she clearly was not feeling well. Her eyes were squinting and she developed this awful twitching, and drooling. She then defecated on our bedroom floor, which she has never ever ever done outside of her box in her whole 8 yrs of life.		I immediatly bathed her with Dawn as another person suggested that they did when this happened to their cat, and we just got out of the tub. She is now cleaning herself after her bath and I hope to God she is going to be fine. I have the emergency Vets number handy just in case.		I plan to go to Petsmart tomorrow and return this product and give them a big piece of my mind.		DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR CAT!!!!
1,This is very greasy and my dog doesn't like it. And this doesn't even have that nice smoky smell.
1,My maltese/lhasa apso mix can grown his fur about 2 inches in 2 months, I was trying to save the money and doing it myself, at least so I don't have to go get him groomed every month. This is the second one I buy,  it didn't work, this kept getting stuck in his fur when it wasn't matted.	It cut very little, it's not as powerful as I thought it would be
1,I don't doubt the positive reviews of many Fluorish Excel users.  However, we had a tragic experience with it killing 5 Electric Blue Ahli cichlids and nearly killing 6 others.  My tanks are stable and very well-cared for, and all of my water parameters were ideal after doing my weekly vacuuming and 75% water change several hours earlier (pH 7.8, kH 120, GH 200, nitrate 10 mg/L, and undetectable ammonia or nitrite).  We used Excel exactly as directed, and even slowly poured it into the stream of water coming out of our filter to disperse it gradually.  Within 20 minutes,  11 fish were lying on their sides on the bottom struggling to breathe and occasionally darting to the top to gulp air.  We immediately moved them to another tank with the same water, but still lost 5 of them.  After searching the web, I found many other instances of similar tragedies with other types of fish.  It also seems to be highly toxic to certain plants, including anacharis and valisneria.  Interestingly, many other fish in the tank seemed OK, including yellow labs, Ciprochromis Leptosoma Tricolor, and bushy nose plecos.		After writing Seachem a very detailed description of my experience, they explained to me that the gluteraldehyde-based compounds in Flourish Excel are chemical reducing agents, and if you just did a major water change, removing most of the organic waste in the tank, than there are few soluble compounds for the Excel to act on and it can chemically reduce oxygen, making it unavailable for the fish to breathe.  However, given the enormous differences in sensitivity of the Ahlis compared to my other fish, I have to wonder if certain species experience direct toxicity to their gills from the Fluorish.  Seachem also said this problem can be exacerbated by the simultaneous use of Seachem's Prime water conditioner, which is also a reducing agent (yes, I used this earlier in the day when I cleaned my tank, but why didn't they mention this on the label?).  Lastly, they said if you add Excel to the tank in the evening, the plants won't utilize it as quickly as in the morning, leaving more of it in the water for the fish to deal with.  None of this was explained anywhere on the product label or on their website.  I understand that many products on the market can be dangerous if used inappropriately.  But if Seachem knows many of the potential problems with Excel and yet chooses not to convey any of it to potential buyers, than they are preventing aquarists from making mindful decisions that affect their fish and plants.  Seachem's response to this was that they will consider putting this info on their FAQ part of their website.  This is unacceptable to me.  While I have loved so many Seachem products over the years, I feel we are looking at corporate irresponsibility when it comes to Flourish Excel.  How the company chooses to handle the situation will tell us lots about whether they are willing to risk reducing sales and profits in order to educate consumers and prevent unnecessary fish and plant loss.
1,I bought this for my 12-pound cat and she hated it.  I think the main reason was that she couldn't see through it.  I bought this size along with the smaller one and maybe I should have tried that size first but she still would have at least part of her vision blocked.  This collar looks like it would work better for dogs.  I had initially purchased the Recovery Pet Cone in pink but thought it was too big.  My cat liked the Recovery Pet Cone better because she could see through it.  I will probably donate these collars since they were not expensive and the return shipping would eat up my return credit!
1,These were sort of easy to put on.  My cat didn't love it, but tolerated me gluing them on and I did manage to do it without help.  At first I thought they were the best thing since sliced bread.  Then... after about 2 weeks they started to grow out, and there is sort of a lip where the new nail meets the softclaw.  Once it got to this point, my cat's claws were getting hung up on all sorts of things;  the carpet, the curtains, pretty much anything he tried to claw would make his paw get stuck and he would start pulling and pulling.  It was scary, really.  I thought "oh my God what if this happens when I'm at work and I'm not here to help him get unstuck".  So... I'm giving up on them and won't be putting them back on.  If you use them, be careful and keep an eye out on your cat after the first week to make sure he/she doesn't have this problem.
1,It lasted 4 months. I live in the Midwest and it's imperative my bearded dragon have a reliable heat source, but this light repeatedly turned off on its own, flickered, and finally died for good. The bulb I had prior lasted 3 years, so this was a huge disappointment and an utter waste of money.
1,The size on this rake is huge and it is heavy. The length is okay but there is not good way to finesse poo out of the grass with something this clunky. If you have anything bigger than a terrier of some kind, this will probably be the rake for you.
1,My lab puppy tore them apart in less then 10 minutes-was able to pull the cloth right off the ball.
1,not a good product.
1,My pit does well with the 14 in ball, so we figured we would try the smaller one for fetch. Boy was that a mistake! Ups dropped it of, I tossed it to my dog, he bit down twice, and it cracked. Waste of 8 bucks : (
1,no grip at all
1,It leeks,don't waste your money on it. Very disappointed.
1,I gave this one star because it's so flimsy. However, the company processed returned easily.
1,Cat wasn't interested.
1,It's a nice massage brush for your pet, but if you're looking for one that will remove hair and prevent shedding, this aint it.  I tried on my medium-hair cat, and it picked up no more than half a dozen.  At least it was very inexpensive.
1,Did not work for us on neighbors dogs.
1,Doesn't work.
1,There's a few things wrong with this water bottle. 1, mine came completely different from what is shown here, not the same design at all, same one I seen at Walmart one time. 2, mine was missing the metal hanger piece. 3, the mouth piece is big and short. A couple hours after I put mine in the pigs cage i noticed my one pig was refusing to use it, so watch your animal after you put a new bottle in to make sure they're drinking, and there was a ton of backwash floating in water, after only like 2 inches of water was gone. horrible. 4, it leaks. so I am no longer using it. Will keep as spare. I have been using an 8 oz Kaytee water bottle with floating duck for quite awhile and wanted a bigger one cuz my guinea pigs drink a lot and I'm filling that one up Twice a day, but I will keep using what I had because mainly too much  guck is getting inside the mouthpiece to quick. I also had to use my spare spring wire to even use this bottle since mine was missing.
1,Leaky, leaky, leaky...
1,I've bought a couple of these pumps now, and that's unfortunately because they tend to break after about 6 months of use (almost to the day, it's bizarre). I do my best to care for the pumps by taking them apart according to the instructions and cleaning them with water, in addition to only using filtered water in the actual pet fountain, and am careful to ensure there is always plenty of water in the fountian itself. Despite that, I still haven't managed to get a pump to last for more than 6 months, and I'm on my third one. If the fountain itself wasn't so nice I would be considering switching to a brand with more reliable pumps. At this point, I'm thinking I should keep a backup pump at home so that when my current one quits I don't have to wait a week to get my fountain running again.		While the pumps are functional, though, they do their job nicely. They're quiet, which is a plus. I've seen several other pumps with noise complaints attached to them, and that's one problem this pump definitely does not have.
1,Made in China now, falls apart, dogs get sick, do not buy!
1,brought the wrong stuff
1,Not sure, will check back after some time passes.  Update:  I've cleaned and sprayed her at least 4 times a day for 4 days, she is still scratching her back on anything she can find. It says it's 100% guaranteed so I will contact the seller.
1,It's cute but made of a "stiff" material with very little give to it.  It was also too small but when I went to return it, the cost of shipping it back wasn't much less than the thing cost so I just kept it and gave it to a neighbor for her 5 lb dog.  Hopefully it fits her.
1,It seems like a good idea and my dog really liked it, however it didn't last an hour before the end came unscrewed and he chewed the threads apart so I can't put it back together. To be fair the packaging does say to supervise dogs while chewing on it but they should make it so it doesn't come apart so easy. The whole point is to keep the dog busy!
1,the bowls are comical, but when the delivery person handed the box to me IT RATTLED, loudly!  I ordered 3,the other 2 were in one piece a chip here and ther.  Instead of wasting postage I'll sell 2 for 25 cent.  Pitched the broken one
1,I really wanted to like this toy. If it didn't have small batteries and brittle plastic inside the mouse I would probably give it two stars, as I can still use the string and the thing that goes over the top of the door with some less dangerous toy tied to it. But at this point I'm watching my cat closely, hoping he didn't swallow one of the batteries or some of the other parts that caused the mouse to squeak so realistically.		I have read reviews of this product elsewhere that talk about how much people's cats love this toy even though it breaks so easily, and I would agree. If you have a kitten or a cat that is less inclined to tear toys apart, it may be okay for you. But I want to let other pet owners know that the instructions on the packaging are correct: this is a toy that should only be used under supervision. I was watching from the next room and even so my cat got the mouse torn open and the plasic and batteries scattered about before I could get to him.
1,Did not fit my dachshund at all in either of their sizes
1,Love the idea, just not this product. My dog goes crazy in the car and I bought this to utilize for my training in the car with him. It keeps him in the back seat which is what I want, but he twists and turns so much that the belt part gets tangled by the time I reach my destination. In the end it is such a pain to take off of him. He is still learning to be calm in the car, but I really don't like the design of this product. I will be looking for a different product to keep my dog safe in the car.
1,This broke the first time I used it. I could tell when the front broke off that it wasn't just a fluke - its cheap plastic badly put together. In comparison - I had an old brush of same make but made with better quality material that lasted over 10 years.
1,This is the first dry food that both my cats and the strays I feed did not like. I am now left with a lot of dry food that nobody eats...
1,broke soon after purchasing
1,Bouoght this for my fishy friends (Tiger Bars & Skirted Tetras) who LOVE LOVE LOVE the blood worms. I thought i would buy them something different they wanted nothing to do with this cube of shrimp.		And after a few feedings i didn't either it made a huge mess of my normally neat tank and destroyed filters i was changing 2 times a month on my 30 gallon tank when i can ususally clean a fliter and use it for about a month or 2.		The product itself is great quality just wasn't right for my set up
1,My Dog hates it, and after making him suffer though the entire jar, I am sorry to say it did little to improve his itching or heal his skin.
1,We used as directed as my dog developed a nasty reaction.  My poor baby. Now I have 1 & 3/4 bottles which I will be tossing.
1,The small I received isn't a Herm Sprenger collar, it was made in China. You can tell because the half moon ring where you clip the leash should say "HS GERMANY". What's odd is last time I ordered from this seller, the medium I received WAS genuine Herm Sprenger and is great. If you're looking for true Sprenger, use caution ordering from this retailer. The prongs on my small were rough cut and sharp and the parts are clunky and aren't aesthetic. I returned it.
1,It is extremely difficult to fill this ball and after going to the trouble of practically having to put one piece of kibble in the hole at a time, my dog doesn't like it anyhow.
1,My dogs did not like these at all.
1,My guys wouldn't use a litter box under this. No idea why.
1,Seems like perfectly good litter but my cat has started peeing in front of his litter box.
1,Worlds best is the best but this is review is for the seller.
1,I didn't buy this from Amazon, I bought it at a local pet store, but I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Either we have some super fleas in the northeast or this stuff just doesn't work. We've pulled ticks off of Mac and we recently had a flea infestation, despite him being dosed on schedule. I spent my weekend de-fleaing the dog, our cats, all our bedding & upholstery, and our rugs. The poor dog had to suffer through a Dawn bath but the look of relief on his face after he realized he felt better was worth it.		I talked to the people at the local shelter (Liberty Humane Society, they rock!) who said they were hearing a lot of these complaints, and they're currently using Activyl, which is like Frontline Plus. I'm going to have to stick with one of them.
1,Not a very visually appealing filter. Does the job, but it is certainly an eyesore in the tank.
1,THIS IS NOT USA MADE, although it is stated that it is. RETURNED THE PRODUCT. My dog sometimes would not eat it, so I looked on the back at the bottom in fine print, it is from China. I will not feed my dog polluted food!
1,My cats don't like it - so I don't like it. This is not for large cats. The litter box is way too small. My 2 cats are 11 & 16 pounds. I would say that an 8 pound cat would be max size to fit in this litter box comfortably - if you want them to "go" in the litter box. It would take some re-training to get a cat to use this type of product - very different texture and feel to the "litter pellets".
1,Waited a month just to throw it out.  Food slides underneath.  Suction cup useless.
1,The large was WAY too small, for my English Bulldog puppy. Pretty disappointed.
1,Poor quality.  It took less than a week for my 9 month old Pomeranian to destroy
1,This is poorly made, Falling apart, and poorly fits together! And it's A LOT smaller then depicted!
1,*****Update 12/18/2015	Totally disgusted---just got a 6 pack of CRUMBS!!!!  There are barely any intact biscuits in the boxes--I opened them--NO MORE!!!! I am totally UNHAPPY!  Dropped the stars down  to 1 !!		Having a MiniPoodle diagnosed with allergies is no fun---when the allergy turns out to be CHICKEN--even more so.		Got these for Shannie and at first whiff she said "NO"...oh Lord-is this special or what----I have SIX boxes.	Then I offered a cookie to Leo---he followed Shannies lead, sniffed and said "no thanks".		Broke cookie in half-offered half to each pupper and they gobbled them down! Looks like we have breakfast cookies!		WEIRD PUPPIES!!  LOL	(I must add- the box is FULL of crumbs, cookie dust and crumbles)		10/29/2012 after opening several boxes it is evident that this "bargain" is because there are few "whole" bones in a box. It appears as if these boxes are full of the seconds-all the broken stuff-not cool.
1,tore it up in one evening
1,I checked around my kittens body when she was sitting on it and I didn't feel any heat anywhere.	Judi
1,had to return these. bought them for my cats, based of a cat blog that liked them. bought according to the weight chart, but my cats could wriggle out of them very easily, like houdini! or they would escape halfway and be in an uncomfortable position with one arm sticking out with their head. If you're buying for a cat, just get the come with me kitty harness - that works really well and is larger than you think (if you have a fat cat).
1,Zipper broke on the first use, even with a small dog.  I turn it around so he zipper faces my car seat. I transport dogs a lot for a rescue and this works well
1,This is a suede dog toy with a squeaker inside made to resemble a unicorn. The toy looks great and, as a display item, is quite nice. If you've got a dog that doesn't especially chew toys and would like to decorate the space the dog occupies with a cute and nice-looking toy, this is a good choice. If you've got a dog that tends to actually chew its toys, it may not be the best choice. The way it is stiffened makes it work well for display and it does make it easier to hold out to a dog (as it won't flop over).		The main issue is the ropes that make up the main start to fray and come apart pretty quick and can be easily ingested in their stringy state. If you've got a dog which likes to play tug of war and it doesn't have a strong enough jaw or sharp enough teeth to unravel or pull out the strings, then this might work for such a dog. Otherwise, it's really just a good decorative object/dog toy and not great in other respects as it starts to come apart too easily.
1,The part that hooks onto the harness is too small to open easily, and does not fit on a Puppia Vest Harness (both D rings). I will order a medium and see if that is better. It does come with a coller with small D rings but it is still too small to open and connect easily and I really like the Puppia Vest Harness. I can not recommend this, especially if you use a Puppia vest/harness or have some arthritis, and I would not buy again. I hope this helps someone.
1,KONG SERIOUSLY STOP! YOUR BALL TOY FOR DOGS  CAN BE TORN APART & EATEN  WITHIN MINUTES! WASTE OF MONEY & WORSE IF I HAD NOT BEEN HOME MY DOGS WOULD HAVE DIGESTED THE PARTS, WHICH THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING. VERY DANGEROUS PRODUCT, SHAME ON YOU!
1,Yes, it's supposed to be a paintball adaptor, which it is, it'll fit on a paintball tanks threads just fine.	But, when I purchased it, it was with the intention of using it with a CO2 regulator for my planted aquarium. No such luck. It didn't fit my regulator at all.
1,This product is not sturdy enough for a hyper 35 pound jack Russell terrier that pulls while walking. It hasn't rip or anything but he makes this vest look soo small when he pulls. It stretches to the max where sometimes I think it will snap one day while walking ...but in a weird way it comes back to it original shape when it comes off. It doesn't really help the situation of making him stop the pulling because the harness is not really close on his body while walking.
1,At first I loved it but then...	When Training a puppy, timing is crucial. So I would tell my 2 month old Golden retriever good job, good girl or I would click the clicker and she'd have to wait for me to dig my way through to get the treat and give it to her. No big deal, I adjusted and simply started holding in my hand and would simply carry on my waist just to have them with me. I love that it has zippered pockets to carry keys, clicker and has a compartment for the disposable bags. It also seems durable, so imagine my surprise when only after 2 months of use it was splitting at the seems and it is now unusable. Looking for a different product. I do not recommend.
1,THIS IS TOO LIQUIDY.		I just tossed the new bottle out	after using it twice. It just does not stick to	anything to even get it on the teeth.		 Another person said it, and it is true.	It just runs off and is useless, or so it seems.		I'm using one of the gels just to be sure.
1,Turned areas on blankets and clothing green after they went through the wash. Looks like a highlighter exploded in my washing machine.		My dog peed on my bed and I used this thinking it would deter him from doing it again. Applied, followed the directions and then washed the blankets and sheets days later after it had time to set with normal detergent. Where ever this was applied turned my blankets green and what's worse is I washed the sheets with other items of clothing and it bled onto them!
1,It did reduce the skunk smell on my dog, but not nearly as much as I wanted and expected.  Tried using it several times, and my dog still smells.  Tried using it in the wash as directed, and the clothing still smells.		Recommend you use the Hydrogen Peroxide treatment you mix yourself.
1,I just received the booties and there cute as hell BUT there TOO small I have a small dog only weights 7 pounds and they don't fit I got the medium's ,they come size wise small and medium's I got medium's they don't fit, so I've thought to replace them but they only have the two size's, oh well guess I can give them as a gift to someone that has a very smaller puppy....there so cute..
1,It didn't last 15 minutes before my dog chewed it off. Returned all the pieces  for full refund. Thanks Amazon!
1,Frontline just no longer works on fleas in Florida.		Im sticking with Comforts from now until it stops working too.
1,Cats hate it
1,Too small!
1,Really a major dissapointment. This pump has a knob on it to control the airflow and it just doesn't do much to the airflow. It is extremely loud and we can hear this pump from our bedroom. I just hooked my whisper pump back up and we can't hear it at all and the whisper has more power. Will not purchase again.
1,I returned
1,junk
1,I purchased this box a while back around when it first came out, I see the price has gone down a bit but I would not even take it for free.		Because I have a bad back I was trying to find a way a could keep the litter box regularly scooped without all of the bending over.  This was not the answer.		You can only put a very small amount of litter in this box at a time, so little that I would end up with the litter soaked completely though and sticking to the box.		When I used the liners that came with it the box kind of worked because the giant clump could come off the liner.  When I used up the liners that came with it I ordered more but they did not fit.  I know I ordered the correct ones because I ordered liners for both trays so I had the two different types.  The ones for the little tray in the bottom never gave me any trouble.  I thought I might have just gotten a bad box, 6 boxes of liners later I gave up on them...hopfully they have resolved that problem by now.		With so much litter sticking to the box I found I frequently had to take it apart and clean the whole thing.  It easily takes 30 minutes taking it all apart, cleaning it out and finding wet litter in the most random places, then putting it back together.		When a moved a year ago I left this box by the dumpster and went back to a regular hooded box.  I have since found a scoop that does not require me to crouch over and am glad to be rid of this box.
1,Bought this production because of the reviews.  Both of my dogs got skin allergy, vomiting and diarrhea from this product.  What a waste of money
1,Dog doesn't like it.  Doesn't understand it.  He's pretty smart but his toy just doesn't work for him.
1,stopped working within 2 hours
1,Just 1 star - I can hear it but dog can't
1,Product missing handle? ????
1,Something like Missing Link is much better but also much more expensive.  The price of Nupro is less for good reason.  Rather than buy Nupro, spend your money on premium food.  Then if your pooch still has issues, try a premium supplement.  Two stars means "I don't like it" but the two stars I gave it means "Not worth it".
1,I didn't see any improvement on my dog skin so I stopped giving it to her after a month.  I'm disappointed.
1,Doesn't do anything at all to contain the smell. We have to change this all the time of the whole room stinks.
1,Appeared to be too large for my Maltese Shin Tzu Mix Puppy..., total RIP OFF product...
1,Leaked the first time I used it , poor quality
1,It lasted about 9 months
1,I bought this for my 5 pound terrier (who just nibbles all day) because my 28 pound terrier wants to eat everything in sight.  Its a great concept but a pricey one.  But I was willing to give it a try if it solved the problem.  Unfortunately, the unit didn't always recognize my dog's chip and sometimes it opened for him and sometimes not.  Sometimes it closed on his head.  Even with that, my little terrier kept trying (ha, terriers! gotta love them).	I contacted SureFlap and they were very helpful trying to resolve the issue - I had several emails with the UK and US divisions.  There are several things you can do that are not covered in the manual.  However, in the end it was decided that this unit was faulty and had to be returned - way too much money to settle for something to work only occasionally.	Unfortunately, the seller (who is in Great Britain btw) wanted me to pay for return postage which I didn't think was right since it was a defective unit.  I got a quote from UPS to send it to GB for over $300.00!!!  And the USPS wanted $75.00.  So just be aware before you order the thing, it its defective you will have a fight on your hands.  I got it resolved, but it took some diligence on my part.
1,Would not recommend this pad holder to anyone. Pad easily comes out of the corner grips and never stays in place and that's with two 4 week old 5 pound puppies using it.
1,I liked the ingredients list. Thought it would be a real healthy treat for my cats... who only eat dry food. They don't like it and won't eat it. Perhaps their eating habits have been corrupted by what they've gotten used to. I'd ask them if I thought they would give me an answer. I'll just have to settle for their silent, but persistent protest.
1,Very tiny. Not safe for any dog. Maybe a cat. Way overpriced. Worth maybe 50 cents.
1,My cat has been eating this for a month and I have not noticed any difference in his weight. I will discontinue using this, especially because it seems to have far less flavor and is too "lite" in texture. Taste-wise my cat has seemed very indifferent towards it but has eaten by default.
1,It didn't work for me my puppy even licked it off of my hand. I sprayed it on my silk tree toilet paper & several places I sprayed it. I've just come to the conclusion that she's a ornery little stinker.
1,Quit working (works now and then)exactly a month after I got it, so return window is closed.  Its something that you don't use alot, so why did it quit working already? Never got wet or dropped.  Piece of junk, waste of money. I'm still contacting Amazon about returning it.  Update: Luckily Amazon is accepting a return on it.  Will spend more money and get one that actually works all the time.
1,Smells awful. Yes, it works but who wants to smell this in their house?
1,MY TURTLES  ALL 11 OF THEM USED TO LOVE THIS STUFF  BUT SOMETHING CHANGED	THEY IGNORE IT NOW AND ONLY EAT THE LIVE FOODS FRESH  VEGGIES OR RAW RED MEATS THEY GET	AND MEOW MIX CAT FOOD  FISH FLAVOR  MIX  I HAVE TRIED MOST EVERY DRIED FOOD OUT THERE AS THIS IS A MORNING SUPPLEMENT TO THIER VARIED DIET AS I HAVE MULTIPLE SPECIES OF TURTLES  WHAT HAPPENED REPTOMIN???
1,My 8 month old puppy got his mouth under it and it was stuck like that within minutes of putting it on him.  Might work for a pug or short nosed dog, but not for him.
1,This does not work at all. I would return it if I could...
1,It does work but you have to use it everyday . I am returning it after using it for a couple of months when I decided to test it on myself. I took a cotton ball with the solution on it and put it to the corner of my eye allowing some of it to get in my eye and it stung like crazy and an hour later it still does. I feel awful now that I used it on 2 of my dogs. Now I know why they hated it so much. My poor babies !
1,Hard work to get it in and it is not doing the job for two dogs.
1,Dog hasn't touched it  Probably a good product but for my dog, it hasn't worked
1,Both of my cats sniffed it and turned away, I bought this because of my cat suffering a urinary tract problem and after reading reviews thought it may be a good product for him... unhappily half of these cans are still sitting in my cupboard and the ones I opened went to complete waste, they wanted nothing to do with it at all.
1,I don't hate it, but my cat does.  She takes two bites and then leaves.
1,Does not work well at all and upsets my dog's stomach. Wondercide's Flea & Tick Spray works much better and he has no bad reaction to it. I also now make homemade flea & tick powder that does an amazing job on both fleas and ticks (do an internet search for the recipe, it has diatomaceous earth, neem powder, yarrow powder and eucalyptus oil). This stuff does smell nice but I won't be wasting my money on it ever again.
1,You have to use more than they say. Doesn't work as good as the smaller bottles. didn't remove the odors at all. Unless I received a bad gallon. I was very disappointed with this since I have been using the smaller bottles for years with no problems.  I feel I wasted my money with the gallon size.
1,About 10 worms alive. The rest were dead.	.
1,My dog loves bully sticks but won't touch them :/
1,Another let down from eshopps. I have the regular 12 inch frag racks already which have horrible magnets. I bought this corner rack for a new 35 cube I set up which has a thinner diameter glass than my 90 gallon figuring it would be fine. Well after placing it in the tank without anything even on it it bounces around when for tap it with your finger. The first issue is of course the magnets they are useless I had to again use a magnet from an old glass cleaner to make it stay put. I have had them fall over just from the flow of a powerhead. The next issue is that the corner is too square so using this in a glass aquarium with a silicone corner seal makes it not sit perfectly square. It would probably be ok for an acrylic tank but why couldn't they just notch the corner out a 1/4 of an inch?? Mad I bought this after I knew the quality wasn't there. Fool me once Eshopps.
1,I love buying things for my hamster. Things he doesn't need but I want. Things that look different but serve the same purpose. Things that look cool but that he doesn't use.		This is one of those things.		I've seen him use it once. I keep a treat block in it so he has a reason to venture inside of it. But he doesn't really play in it. Then again, he is more of the	nesting/wheel type. All creatures have preferences. This just isn't Hamlet's preference of entertainment.		So in my home, this is just something that looks cool in the cage. It doesn't get much use.		As far as the assembly. I could not do it. I get frustrated very easily so my friend had to do it. It took about 30-40 minutes..Have fun with it.
1,This is not a toy for anything other then a small dog. The croaker was broken in under a minute.  I believe it croaked 5 times and then it didn't work.  my dog then pulled the croaking mechanism out.  I had to rush to grab the mini batteries so he didn't eat them.
1,They never mailed the product :( these looked so cute but to not mail and not notify me they weren't mailing them was disappointing especially since I had a puppy coming and needed this.
1,My dogs did not like it.
1,it was a bit complicated to place over my dog.  Too  much hassle for a harness for me and my bully.
1,Since installing these new flaps I have trouble getting the doors down and locking (I put a door on both sides).  I have to play around with it until it decides to work, but it still doesn't lock.
1,sounds squeeky
1,Grove is too big can not use it .
1,Disappointed very cheap material. Looks like a dollar store toy with a squeaker. Not worth the price at all. Doesn't even look like the picture
1,Neither one of my cats would go near this and they love catnip toys.
1,My outdoor feral cats that I feed wouldn't even eat these.  They are just too healthy to be appetizing I guess.
1,unrealiable.  bought two for betta tanks.  almost lost betta because of this thing....  put in another thermometer, and water was too cold, even this one showed 80 F.	invest couple bucks more for higher quality and to save your fish stress.
1,These personally didn't work for my dog. Plus after the first packet it was hard for me to get him to even smell the second package.
1,Our betta fish spits them out and then ignores them.  I think they may be too big.
1,This is fine if you're just brushing to comb out knots, but it doesn't really do much to brush out the undercoat. Get a Furminator -- you won't regret it.
1,my cat prefers wet food
1,I thought these were supposed to be indestructible. Not for my two year old lab. Lasted maybe a week at most.
1,I have a brand new car and did not want the Velcro strips on the window sill so I used the "tabs" option. Both covers blew out the window on the freeway the VERY first day.	I'm really disappointed. I will have to go back to my DIY "cloth taped to the window" option. Wish I had not spent the $$
1,Coverage was not good at all.  I returned these.
1,im really disappointed. this clamp claims to accommodate a 3/4" arm but that's a lie. my arm is 3/4" arm and too big for this clamp. I'll be returning.
1,Toss the whole jar. Neither dog would eat this no matter how bad I tried to disguise it.
1,i rec'd this item and did return to amazon because this item did not have the thickness in the pad , my carpeting had more cushing for my dog as Stubby proved it by sleeping on the carpet instead of the pad
1,my dog chewed through this in 1 hour
1,My lab went through all three in five throws. Busted the first two on the first throw, busted the last one on its third throw. There was no chewing, just fetch using a Chuck-it. It's your choice to purchase these. I have three others that haven't left the bag.
1,Not as affective as rollers with tape
1,The first bite it broke.
1,I would have liked to give a good review I tested it by blowing thru one side to determine the direction air should  flow but I was able to blow air threw both sides	Tossed it reached into the bag tried another. air would not pass threw either end At that point I realized I order a hell of a lot of items from Amazon and u gotta get burned to appreciate the good  pass this bargain up
1,We had to take the top off and leave the bottom open.  My husband said when he tipped it to clean it out cat's BM and pee caught when he	tipped it back.
1,Low quality. Next time will spend more and get something more durable. Broke after 2nd use.
1,Rubber bottom cracking and looks like it will start crumbling very soon. The blue of the rubber has faded and looks to be breaking down. It makes me wonder if tiny rubber bits are ending up all over my other dishes in the dishwasher.		I've had three of these dishes (and a larger bowl for water) for 2.5 years. I was very happy with them and would have rated them 5 stars until now.		I wash the dishes in the dishwasher once per week. I hand wash them every day. When hand-washing, I only wash the inside of the bowl, and simply rinse the underside where the rubber is. When I bought these bowls I was under the impression I would never have to replace them. That doesn't seem to be the case. I will be replacing them with stainless steel bowls without a rubber ring on the bottom.
1,It's OK, it falls over and scares the dogs.  Gave it to my friend with cats.
1,My puppy does not have the most sensitive stomach but he ate a 1/4 can of this stuff and has been a non-stop poop machine since.  Not sure WHAT in this food is bugging his stomach, but man has he been miserable.
1,I guess I should have looked closer at the picture as I have never seen cholla wood this small.	In the local pet stores the stuff they have is about as big in diameter as a silver dollar. All I have ever seen is that size or bigger. The stuff I got was about the same diameter as a dime.	For length they are all exactly 6" long		Well off to the internet to get a big one with some character. For what I payed for 6 pieces I could get a nice 3" multi branch elsewhere.		I suppose if you wanted to build small trees for aquascape these could be just what you are looking for. If you are looking for a big pile of cholla to condition water for your shrimp, shop else where.
1,Entertaining but dog who is 18 month old has almost completely unstrung it in 6 months.
1,This LEAKS! i bought this to replace my old one that ive had for years, installed today and discovered water puddling up under the tank on my wood floor, this is leaking water FROM THE ELECTRICAL CABLE coming from the filter housing, this could have been alot worse than the puddle of water! It says do not return to seller so i just used it for parts and used my old filter housing and used the new pipes and propeller. Not happy, if you buy this please check its not leaking before someone gets electrocuted.
1,Super cool looking scratch post but unfortunately it has broken permanently after 2 weeks of use. I have one cat (10 lbs, energetic 3 yo) who likes to run up to scratch posts and this one was not sturdy enough. The post stays upright through a hole in the base board, but once that hole tears just a little bit then you can't keep the post upright at all.
1,Cat used to eat with gusto, now won't go near it.  And it looks old and coming loose from the sides.
1,Where is the dog treat?  The pieces are so small, not chunks and its like dust in a bag.  Disappointing because my dog loves these but there is nothing to give him.  Wont buy again.
1,One was broken on arrival.  Not impressive.
1,Pet food reviews are difficult to review as "I don't like",  After all, prior to ordering this food,  I read the other reviews, trust this company and "liked" the ingredients.  Then the arrival of the case and my cats said, NO, thank you.  Not today, Nor tomorrow. Take it to the shelter, now, please!"  And the shelter was grateful.
1,Garbage.
1,i can't tell if it's this, or the turmeric powder, but it upset my dog's stomach.
1,I like the concept and it does keep my pup from eating her pads, mostly, as long as I tuck every little bit of the pad away. None can remain sticking out.	A couple of issues:	- if the dog poops, it can be hard to clean out of the grate pattern.	-it's an odd size. You have to do origami with the pad to fit it in there and then it's small, so there is an increased likelihood that your dog will pee or poop off the side while they are standing on it.		Lesson learned. It's been ok for training, but I wouldn't buy again.
1,I am really hard on stuff like this because I hike with my dog every week and I also run a dog hiking service, AND I live in Oregon where it rains a lot (dogs end up covered with mud after a fall/ winter/ spring hike), so there are muddy dogs in my car more often than not. During the winter my dog also hangs out in my car while I am at work. I got this for Christmas and by March it was falling apart. The waterproof backing is peeling off, flaking off into my car. The worst thing about this, though, are the holes for the seat belts to pass through. I guess if you have people in your back seat you want them to be able to buckle up and be safe (as for me, I would never have a person sit in my back seat unless I took the cover out first and thoroughly cleaned everything. My backseat is pretty much dedicated to dog transport). There is no way of closing the holes in the cover-- no velcro or buttons or snaps or anything-- and it defeats the whole purpose of having a car seat cover in the first place. Especially when  a dog is standing on the cover, it spreads the holes even wider, and all the mud, twigs, water, pine needles, and DOG HAIR make their way right through those holes and onto your seats.
1,These do not work.  Bottom line.  They are no more than EXPENSIVE treats.  21 for $8 at the pet store? I will NEVER buy these again.  I wasted so much money.  My dog has separation anxiety...which it states on the back that is designed specifically for.  I even gave them to my dog when I was home to see if he calmed down...and he just acted normal.  DO NOT BUY
1,I never like to send things back when I order them, really inconvenient. I research the product and go through the reviews to assure I'm buying what I really want. I needed and ordered a XS and was sent a medium. No way to fix that!
1,This got shredded day one
1,I ended up giving it away- the cats don't like the pulling.  Not only that but the blade is too long- half the size would be much more appropriate for cats, and even then short hair cats only.  It works wonderfully on Diogi my friend's airdale cross.  Great product but not for long hair cats.
1,These are not the size pictured. They are so tiny, only a 4-6 week old kitten will fit.
1,within 5 minutes of my dog ( a lab mix) playing with the toy it ripped - nearly in half!  I haven't had the time to try to return it but I must!  NEVER recommend this product!
1,Received this today from Amazon and even though the toy is very cute, it is also very mute.  I squeezed it everywhere but there is nothing inside except foam!  I am sure my Chi will still play with it but am rather disappointed.  Wish someone had checked it before packing it off to Mexico ... :o(
1,I ordered this product as my dog loved an "identical" product I'd bought her while on vacation.  The original was vibrant yellow, and my puppy chewed it for months until it's head had come undone, so I decided to track down a replacement.  I found this and several other toys from the same manufacturer, and the price was well below what I'd paid as an impulse at Spot in NYC.		Unfortunately, either the product is from a different source or there has been a huge problem with storage.  The first thing I noticed was the color was faded and muddy compared to the original - not a big deal.  But almost immediately I was hit by the musty smell - I'd believe it if it had been a victim of Katrina and had been in a flooded basement for a few weeks - no way I'd allow my dog to use this product.  As another reviewer had durability problems for the blue lion, I suspect this is a very cheap knockoff of a good product - and my puppy can chew any toy to death in a day, most of the time.	.	Because of the price, I bought each of the three different toys as part of the same order - all smelled the same.  Wrote the company, and got a quick response they would get back to me promptly - a month has passed and not a word.		Not worth the time and aggravation to send it back.  It's just left a bad taste in my mouth, and not because I've chewed on it
1,Leaked halfway out in shipment. Didn't work well either.
1,Too big for my conure and Congo African Grey, and they don't like them. But my dog loves them. I would not buy them again, however.
1,This is not as big as some of the reviews claim.  Its long, but alot of space is taken up by the 2 large scoop/accessory compartments.  It is also REALLY Cut into in the front with a larg curve that takes up most the front end space.  The area for the actual cat and litter is only about as big as some standard litter boxes.  My mom as 2 very large Main Coon/Siamese cats and this will NOT work for them. I returned this because the litter area is no bigger than the standard box my mom has now for her big cats. Between the wasted Curve in the front of the box and wasted compartments on the side, it was useless for us.  This was a disappointment and did not work for us.  We found a larger box at PetSmart that did not have the curved front end.
1,These are WAY too small for my adult cat to play with safely. This might be good for a kitten, but I held up one to my cat's mouth, said NOPE, and shipped them back promptly for return.
1,didn't work very well, used daily had 10 teeth pulled.
1,I ordered the size that was to go on my K&H cot, it was too small.  So I ordered the next size up, it was huge and can't be used.  Tired of shipping things back because the sizes are NOT correct.
1,Not the right size for a cat, maybe a small dog.
1,I ordered these dog harnesses before and they were the same size small. These two harnesses were several inches shorter than the prior order and can't return them. This brand is inconsistent in size. Don't buy this item . I feel ripped off.
1,Much smaller than expected.  This would probably work well for a kitten, but not even a small cat.
1,My puggle, who weighs all of 15 pounds, took off today and Flexi took off after him. Pug is a newly adopted rescue dog;  I got this due to the reviews. it stopped retracting about two months ago, and it completely broke today. it will not retract at all; it just dangles, tangling him all up. i'm a very unhappy woman. The "classic leash" means it's a cord:  if your dog tangles around your legs or pulls under a porch, and the cord hits your leg, you'll have torn skin and scars. Buy the BELT LEASH by Flexi; it's amazing. I've purchased two and each has lasted for years!
1,UPDATE DEC 2014: I'm changing it to two stars from five. Here's why.		After feeding my bird this food for two years, last year when I took my parrot to the vet, she was lipemic, had a slightly enlarged liver and was overweight. All this from eating too much fatty foods. The only possible culprit was this food mix. I now accept as truth what we all read all the time about birds and which many of us repeatedly ignore. Pet parrots should be eating pellets, and offering them mixes like this allow them to select the nuts and seeds first, ignoring the rest and causing them to "hold out" for the good stuff - bad eating habits. If a food mix has nuts and seeds in it, it is junk food. This was hard to face but I did, and have now transitioned my bird to an all pellet mainstay diet, and save the nuts for treats and enrichment. She is no longer lipemic. Only offering nuts irregularly encourages her not only to recognize pellets as food, but to eat pellets REGULARLY, because she isn't holding out for junk.		The fun and good stuff from the Higgins mixes, I can still offer her on the side. A cinnamon stick, star anise, juniper berries -- these are all still great, and she can have them as fun snacks. So, I should thank Higgins for the ideas of offering these things. Wish they made treat packs of these things, WITHOUT the nuts/seeds mixed in.		OLD REVIEW:		This is my go-to food for my Jardine's parrot.  Some foods have too much filler (seeds) and some have too much junk food (peanuts).  The Tikal blend does have a few larger seeds - sunflower, cantaloupe, and those teardrop shaped white ones...  However, this seed variety creates a wide range of foraging opportunities that keep my parrot engaged.  There are other unusual, vitamin-rich foods like juniper berries and cranberries that are a special bonus in this food mix - and they aren't just for looks - my bird loves them.  I also love that it contains legumes (peas - another favorite of my bird).  Peanuts and sunflower seeds are not in this mix (I don't think) but almonds and cashews are, in small amounts.  So, of the "treat" and "filler" categories, the Tikal mix contains the best possible options.  I do not notice her eating the chamomile flowers, dried fruit or coconut shavings, and cannot discern whether bee pollen is ingested or valuable in any way.  My Jardine's doesn't always eat everything each day, but goes for different ingredients on different days, which suggests to me that she is engaged mentally with the food.  All in all, I feel this food offers a wide nutrient profile with very few "bad" foods - and what foods might be considered "bad" are the best of the bad (almonds, not peanuts).  Aside from the good nutrition, I absolutely love that after chowing on this food, my bird smells like all kinds of crazy, exotic ingredients (favorite: pine tree smell from the juniper berries).  Very cute.
1,My dog is picky and will not even sniff at these treats, let alone eat them
1,This was not as pictured.  Other reviews and the picture showed a HANDLE on this crate.  There is NO HANDLE.  This is NOT a carrier.  I bought this to take my cats/toy poodle back and forth to the vet but it's useless for that purpose because there is no handle so there is no way to carry it.  But return shipping expensive so I can't return it so I'm stuck with something that is just going to take up space in the closet. Very disappointed.
1,Dogs don't like it.
1,My cats didn't like it. Sorry.
1,After three days I thought this stuff worked.  Four days later she's still full of worms.	She weighs 17 lbs so she certainly had enough with each dose.  I'm sending this back.
1,It is TINY. Who knows where it is after it rolled under the couch like a golf ball.
1,Total failure...my dog still has ringworm that's spreading....no money for vet!!
1,Our senior dog, almost 17 years old, has accidents.  We thought pee pee pads would work but she sometimes uses them, sometimes misses them.  So we thought maybe getting an inddor turf potty pad would work.  Nope, she won't go near it.  Could be that she's just too old to train but even when we gate her up, she'll go on the floor rather than on this pad.  It might be best to train a puppy but probably not for your old senile dog.
1,It's like box shape and too big to fit in regular car and hot choth price is high too
1,I bought 2. One for my 7lb tiny dog and it was way way too small and one for my 13lband it was too long and too narrow and I measured my dogs before ordering.
1,So far I am not amused.  It has been in my 1.25gal betta bowl for over 48 hours.  The water temperature has not changed at all.  When I touch it in the water, it doesn't feel even the slightest bit warm. Even at 5w I would expect to feel a little warmth from it.  I don't think it works.  :-(
1,very smelly
1,Wants to be groomed via hand and this isn't really cutting it.  I tried multiple times but she doesn't seem to impressed.
1,Does not work at all. The photograph of the man holding the lead as if he's going to lift that Lab is completely misleading. Chokes my old, small Golden Retriever. Strangles him. I measured and got the correct size.
1,This is a cute idea but it lays sideways most of the time as our full size Syrian hamster just knocks it over.  The spaces between ladder steps are large so it's a little awkward for walking across.  Just another chew toy.
1,This grass started to mold before my cat could even eat it. I'd say it molded within 3 days of planting... I would really not recommend this product for your animals.
1,I've bought TOTW from Amazon for over a year and it's been so convenient to have the 30 lb bags delivered. But there's something very wrong with the past several bags (wetlands, southwest canyon and high prarie). My dog rapidly developed severe GI issues and the vet ruled out all other possible causes. It stops when I put him on a bland chicken & white rice diet. It's not allergies either as the exact same TOTW food purchased from the neighborhood petstore is fine. It's only the bags from Amazon.		Don't know if it's a issue from the warehouses or what (the food does smell different recently, slightly sour). From the reviews here I'm hardly the only one! Amazon was great about a refund but sadly now I can't trust ordering this.
1,Sturdy prod but pups are not a huge fan of it.
1,Package arrived with completely wrong items inside! :/ will definitely request for return/refund!
1,Very pleased with these Hydor 25w heaters. Because the suction cups hold the heater at least an inch away from the side of the tank, they can be used with plastic and acrylic tanks.  They are perfect for heating small  (2.5 to 3 gallon) betta tanks. (Yes! bettas DO need heaters to remain healthy Don't let anyone tell you they do not need heaters and can live in a flower vase or half gallon tank. Not True!)  I will  be purchasing more of these.		UPDATE:  it is now about a year and every single one (total of 9!)  of these heaters has malfunctioned. Some completely died after 5 or 6 months. One after only  3 months of use. The rest no longer hold the correct temperature. I have since dumped all, and replaced with Cobalt Neo-Therm heaters. More expensive, but also more dependable. I highly advise readers to look into the Cobalt brand heaters. As far as the Hydors.......Never again! From 5 stars to 1 star.
1,Bad quality, used only about 2 weeks
1,Would recommend for light chewers or smaller mouthed dogs...one of my dogs bit the nub off after two days...gone..rubbish....		Will not purchase again for my dogs, but again, for smaller dogs or light chewers, Im sure would be a good item.
1,My dog does not like these despite the beefy smell. Maybe they don't taste good to her.
1,To big. for sm dog.
1,I bought this and a Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Chew Toy Original flavor and a BULLIBONE. The BULLIBONE was a big hit now I have to buy 2 more. I have a weiner dog, a Chiweeine and a Chipin and the Chihuahua's will chew on almost anything. But they won't touch the Nylabones at all. They are still laying on the floor where after sniffing them they left them. I accidently dropped the package these Nylabones came in and they did chew on it. Waste of money for me!
1,I bought 6 of these pads for my cattery.  They worked fine for about 1/2 of a season, but then 4/6 quit working.  Very expensive for an item that lasts only a few months.  Unfortunately, there are no other similar products out there that might be more reliable, so I, like so many others, will have to buy some more.  Without competition, there is no impetus for the company to improve their product.
1,The sliders broke the first time I used this litter box so every time I use it it leaked litter all over the place
1,Consumer Labs, which does independent analysis of supplements, reports this dog vitamin exceeds acceptable levels of lead!  It also found less Vitamin C than the label says.  Less Vit C would not upset me as it poses no threat, but knowing I have been giving my pet a daily multi that contains lead is very disturbing!  My dog's annual latest lab results showed disturbance of his liver enzymes. Look this up for yourself before buying the product.
1,It has two stars because, for the purpose, it works. Good luck programming it.
1,My dog isn't a bark enthusiast; however, he'll once in awhile go nuts when someone passes by my house or when I leave him alone in his pen.  So when I got this product I tried it out immediately & he stopped barking.  He looked a bit confused and curious at the same time at the device.  So it worked for a bit in the beginning.  I noticed now, if my dog is in a very hyper mood this device won't stop him from barking.  I can also hear the high pitch sound.  It doesn't hurt my ears unless I put it directly to my ear.  So if you have a dog that looooves to bark constantly, this product isn't for you.  I also have another dog at my parent's house that is spoiled rotten and loves to bark at anyone & at anything. So when I used it on him, he got mad...growled at me & then continued barking like crazy.  As a result, this product won't work for my parent's dog but it works on my dog...sometimes.
1,My cat didn't want to eat it but I assume it's not the treats' fault.
1,My large dog (75lbs) had it ripped apart in about 5 min
1,Not worth the money .
1,My cat would not eat this, aside from the gravy. She would leave every scrap of meat behind, which caused me to look closer at the ingredients. You know those famous videos of how McDonald's makes its chicken nuggets, the pink sludge? That's basically what this is. I was confused when every "flavor" of meat looked the exact same. This is why. I quickly changed brands. We're now on Rachel Rays grain-free wet food, and she devours that stuff!
1,As with all products I always read the labeling.  That said, I was surprised to see all the legalese on this products label.		Examples:	It is a violation of federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling		"CAUTION- : HAZARDS TO HUMANS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS		"Harmful if absorbed through skin. Causes moderate eye irritation. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, or clothing. Wash hands thoroughly with plenty of soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum, using tobacco, or using the toilet. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse."		Further down,		 "Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes" if you come into contact with it.	So it appears that when washing our dogs I must invest in long gloves, a rubber apron and face mask to stop any splatters when they shake off the water/shampoo?		Conclusion -  Either too many lawyers writing labels or the product is really to dangerous to use.
1,to small...
1,I bought these as a treat for my Chinchilla who loves treats but I had to end up throwing these away because he wouldnt touch them.
1,I didn't like this. it was sticky and did nothing.  The shampoo is great though. My do has long hair (shih tzu) so maybe it will work for short hair dogs
1,Purchased Feb 1, 2016.  Received order through Prime Feb 3, 2016.  Expiry date for the four 1 lbs bags is June 14, 2016.  Duration until expiry from receipt: 132 days.  So either the manufacturer or Amazon expects me to feed my small dog quite a few treats per day. Not willing to sacrifice his health like that. Buyer beware of the short expiry date.  Other reviewer noted similar issue.		A local national chain pet store had Dentastix products with an expiry that bordered on the one year mark though in a different format.		Will not be ordering this product from Amazon again.
1,I don't recommend this.  My puppy chewed off large, sharp chunks of plastic!  Really not good.
1,My dogs hate this food.  I have tried mixing with other food and they pick this one out and spit it in the floor.
1,Very bright and attracts attention... while it works. Stopped working in about 2 weeks of daily use (about an hour a day). My dog plays a lot, which includes a lot of wrestling with other dogs, and I would assume that a dog collar would be able to stand up to that. Wrong. The button is so easily pressed that the collar turned on and off several times in one wrestling session. After about a week, the diodes started to turn off, one by one, until they were all off. I figured that it was probably just cheap batteries and replaced it, still doesn't work. Only one light, the one closest to the button, lights up now. Complete waste of my money.
1,update:	Durability was poor.  It lasted a month with my rescue dog. It definitely would be better if it was made of thicker material.		I love this leash.  This is the only one so far where I am able to control my Great Pyrenees puppy.		My only concern is the her teething my break the leash.  So I only wish it was thicker to stand up to the wear and tear.
1,Adorable but my kitty kids were totally disinterested. I gave it to my neighbor's cat. Catnip didn't enhance its allure for my kids. I think kittens would be the ideal customer for this product.
1,HorribleQuality
1,The pee would seep through...
1,Our dog still pulled on walks while wearing this harness. And because she pulled, the harness fabric began to rub away the fur on her chest! I felt terrible when I noticed that. We stopped using the harness and instead enrolled her in obedience classes. Wish we'd done that in the first place, instead of wasting our money on this harness!
1,Maybe my dog just got used to the sound but I feel like these little cans don't work as well as the larger one?  Am I making this up?
1,used not new
1,Messed up my dogs stomach both times I used it! Messed up to the point where she had to go to the vet. It was serious
1,Worked well for a little over a month, then one of the two outlets stopped producing an airflow.  Used barely too long to return to Amazon.  I am buying a different pump to replace it.
1,I did not like this shampoo-the smell was awful. Dog did not smell good-had to use another shampoo.
1,I have 3 large labs who are well fed, this just can't handle them scooping every other day.	It's fine on old dried turds in the yard, but just can't handle fresh ones or much of anything for a day after it rains.	After a few fresher pickups it starts to collect in the tube & stick, then clog, I found myself hitting it on the fence to knock it into the bag which makes the bag come loose. I stuck with it for a month, it's out in the trashcan along with the extra pack of bags waiting to be picked up tomorrow. It may be fine for smaller dogs, not for big dogs.
1,Waste of money. Our kitten barely fit in the dome and didn't have room to use it.
1,First made for small pets. Our small dog and cat drink fine ,our lab slashes water all over because the water fall over hang. Also water capacity not the best. Both of those I could live with and still would have rated 4-5 stars. Reason I rated 1 star is due to the fact that I bought it not even one month ago and the pump is dead as door nail. I could understand a pump going out after 6 months or so of continuous running , but a month is just not acceptable.
1,Horrible!!! Literally sitting here listening to my dog bark while wearing the collar...I've had a collar previously from another manufacturer and it worked great..not impressed by this one don't waste your money..
1,I have 3 giant breed dogs. I was looking for a raw hide alternative. This was enjoyed by my dogs but gone in about an hour. Kind of expensive for how long they lasted.
1,My lab went through all three in five throws. Busted the first two on the first throw, busted the last one on its third throw. There was no chewing, just fetch using a Chuck-it. It's your choice to purchase these. I have three others that haven't left the bag.
1,Really gross. It was like constantly dealing with wet, really stinky sand.
1,It does not work, waist of money :(
1,I can't even make it squeak so I know why my dog doesn't bother with it!
1,I've used brushes with much better quality.
1,I live in Florida with 80 degrees at 5:00 AM. The collar contents has defrosted within 20 minutes. Good idea but it doesn't work.
1,This runs way too small. Large fits a chihuahua ?
1,I've got two Westies and my boy poked a good hole in his first day within 20 minutes.  The regular Kong squeeze balls that I've bought are tougher and lighter- important when chucking and bouncing around the house in Winter.  I was so happy with those I thought I'd upgrade to a crackler.  Wrong decision- I think its the actual crunchy/crackle that enticed my boy to mistake a toy for a bone/food.  I can't say for sure but after buying at least 6 regular Squeeze balls that those are a better value for us.
1,This leash is NO Flexi-Leash. I noticed from day one that the retraction was weak and rough compared to a Flexi-Leash. After 5 months of use one of the leashes would not retract and almost killed my dog. Just get one of the split-lead nylon braided leashes and keep your dog alive. I rhink a lot of these positive reviews are faked or the people have not had the leash long enough to realize it will not last that long. It is a Chinese POS. Get one of these instead.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Heavy-Duty-Tangle-Free-Dual-Double-Dog-Leash-54-inch-Long-with-Braided-Nylon-and-Soft-Grip-Handle-in-Black-Coupler-Dog-Pet-Dog-Lead-Leash-For-Twin-Large-Medium-Small-Dogs/dp/B06XMY2J4R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Heavy-Duty Tangle Free Dual Double Dog Leash 54 inch Long with Braided Nylon and Soft Grip Handle in Black-Coupler Dog Pet Dog Lead Leash For Twin Large Medium Small Dogs</a>
1,Very cute collar with lovely smell, but for the price really expected some calming action for my hyper little bichapoo.  No such luck.
1,too big for my Multipi
1,The lid doesn't close properly. It's an accident waiting to happen when my chinnies will jump out and the lid comes with. It's not the same as the picture.
1,This product was advertised as 59" wide and was much smaller.  I returned it.
1,At first, I was happy with the product because my dog wasn't pulling nearly as hard as before. But then I noticed that the side strap pushes up into her eye, making it water and become irritated, when we walk. I tried fixing the problem but nothing worked, it kept going into her eye. The product was definitely a waste of money.
1,Not worth the cost.  My cats don't get it.
1,The image for the sizing chart and the sizing chart that are in the description are completely wrong and contradict what is on thr package itself.
1,NOT self cleaning. You have to roll it over 3 times and it makes a huge MESS. I do NOT recommend this product and to call it "self cleaning" is waaaaay misleading!!
1,Nice looking but thin cover slides around on foam base and my dog nearly slid off and hurt herself.  Returned.
1,the wands do not even fit on the smarty cat toy.  very disapointed I can't use it.
1,Way way too small-gave it away. Its well made but way too small for our 70 pound Labridoodle. Measure before ordering.
1,The bottom of the pan has a raised center which leaves room for dirty cat litter to hit which leads to the pan needing to be washed twice as often.
1,Not so pleased: It broke the second day I had it and maybe it's just the motor - which from reviews I understand the manufacturer will replace- but really?		I tried troubleshooting to no avail and then calling the company, no one ever answers but they give you this convoluted email to send your query to. Really?		So now I need to work on getting this (allegedly no charge, we shall see) replacement motor.		For now, I have a $40 plastic 2-level water bowl- neat.
1,Ordered 2. Received one. Disappointed.  This is not the same item as described.
1,It work great at first but now it doesn't faze him at all. Our trainer said how great it is. Guess not when you have a Labradoole he so relax about everything nothing bothers him..
1,The design of this should make it work like a handi wipe box so there is always a wipe ready at the top of the container.		the wipes are very thin & puny - the plastic exit is hard and sharp. I have no idea if this solution works or doesn't because it shreds every wipe I manage to pull out. I can't use it as designed and it is awkward to use just tearing off those transparently thin little sheets- my cat got too wiggly as i was fiddling with these so I had to skip it. Waste of time & cash.		Just use some liquid solution and cotton rounds instead.
1,I love ZippyPaws and have bought my Shih Tzu Aaleyah quite a few but this one failed straight out of the bag !  It's suppose to have 3 squeakers and upon testing them BEFORE I gave this to her one wasn't working at all.  She played with this for a short time and the second squeaker failed.  If a toy doesn't squeak Aaleyah has no interest.  This is the first ZippyPaws toy that was a total disappointment.  I don't like spending money on a FAIL.  The turtle they sell with 6 squeakers lasted almost a year.
1,I didn't realize that I wasn't ordering the "vest" version of this product line, which I have (and love) for my other dog. My puppy did NOT like having this slipped over his head and it was very difficult to take off.  I strongly recommend the vest version - it's put on the dog like a backwards coat.
1,I'm not sure why everyone loves this cage but it just did not work for me. After having it for less than 24 hours, I opened the top and the odor of urine was overwhelming, and I am using Carefresh natural. The small air holes in the top are definitely not enough for air circulation.		My chubby Syrian barely fits in the tubes and she has to lay upside down to drink from the water bottle.		Even with another base attached this is extremely small. It's a great design but very poorly executed.
1,You tend to get what you pay for... this was reasonably priced, but it is very cheaply made, with loopy old-style shag carpet and a twisted sloppy sisal application.  Loopy carpet like this can damage cats nails... sloppy application of the sisal will tear apart in a few months... if not a few weeks.		I like this particular "style", with the post at the back of the platform.. it needs to be placed up against a wall for proper support, but the "L" shape gives enough foot room and the post is tall enough for a good stretch.. that's the only reason I purchased it, had I known the quality of construction I never would have ordered it.		In general, I prefer Molly & Friends products, they offer very well made cat furniture, at reasonable prices, but I recommend buying from merchants or sites that offer a clear choice of custom colors with free shipping.  You don't want to end up with 30 year old carpet remnants from some old motel chain, on a piece of furniture in your living room!
1,Addendum 16 May:  I thought I was making a good choice for my little guys health.  But, as I was washing it tonight I noticed the rubber looked dark so I tried to rub it off with the dish cloth.  On closer inspection I saw that the rubber had come loose and there was gross, black mold throughout the entire rubber cover.  I had already had a problem with some of the rubber on the protrusions inside and had to pull those off.  But I didn't realize how the rest of the runner was wearing.  I really thought this bowl was the answer to my pups voracious eating habit, but I don't want to make him sick from the nasty mold.  I would gladly buy the bowl without the rubber/silicone, or whatever it is.		This has really slowed my little gobbler down quite a bit. He normally scarfs his food down so fast, and then tries to steal the other dogs' food. This slowed him down enough to let the other dogs finish their meals in peace!  Even though he still finishes his food in record time, he stays entertained by looking for more.  He has an interactive toy that he has to pick up pieces to get a treat.  I think he thinks this is like that.  Really amusing to watch him at work!  The bowl is very durable and washes up nicely.  I am extremely impressed with the high quality!
1,Not for cat litter
1,I followed the setup directions perfectly. My two dogs pay no attention to the bark machine.  It has no adverse affect on them at all. I have a Yorkie and Maltipoo, and when the Mail Carrier, UPS, FedEx, people or animals pass by my front door or window they go crazy wild with the barking. The maltipoo nearly tears down the curtains at the from bay window. This is the second ultrasonic bark device I've tried this year.
1,Functions as described but too small and cumbersome to use.
1,My dogs are very heavy/tough chewers. Most of the Tuffy toys are well made and stand up, but some don't. Here's the rundown:		Recommend these:	 - Ultimates Tug-O-War: Had this for over a YEAR and still holding up strong (no tears at all).	 - Lobster: Had it for over six months before it finally succumbed to canine teeth and tug-of-war battles. Worth it!	 - Turtle: After a year of heavy chewing, tug-of-war and knawing...it finally gave way. Well worth the price.	 - Crab: Still going strong after six months of heavy chewing and tugging.		DO NOT BUY THESE:	 - Lizzy Lizard (DO NOT BUY): The mouth is the weak spot. My dog tore into the mouth and had stuffing everywhere within an hour.	 - Shark (DO NOT BUY): Similar to the Lizard, my dog tore into the weak spot (the mouth) and had stuffing everywhere within an hour.	 - Wesley Whale (DO NOT BUY): There's a soft spot in the belly, my dog had it open and guts everywhere in less than 24 hours.	 - Polly Pig (DO NOT BUY): All of the stitching is heavy duty, except for the now...right where my dog had it opened in less than a few hours. There was no bacon inside. :(	 - Octopus (DO NOT BUY): This one lasted a few days. Eventually my canine companion busted through the head.
1,I tried this with my toller and it took him about 15seconds to remove all squirrels from the tree.  Sure he loves the small squirrels and just carrying around the big trunk but he could have the same excitement from any small squeaky toys.  I was hoping that it would take him a bit longer to get the squirrels out but alas it takes me longer to stuff them in.
1,We have two cats one of which is a bit dumpy.  We thought that this Pet Feeder would be a good solution for portioning out their meals.  Unfortunately, the display is impossible to read.  It like the old fashioned digital clocks... it looks like block letter 8's.  No matter what light or position we put it in we can't work out the settings.		Also... the food storage container is made of very thin plastic.  Not good for keeping the food fresh.		No bueno.
1,Product not good for pets. Five steps from the dog and the light comes unscrewed and you get to look for the battery and the light cover since all that is left is what's on collar. Have three dogs, attached all three lights at night and let them outside. Same result with all three. The company did refund half of the money, but what good does that do?
1,Too small, size not true, can't use
1,Fish flavors: Splash Dance (blue can) La Isla (purple can), and Two to Tango (red can) have NO BONES. ***KITTY GONE WILD (pink can*) HAS DANGEROUS BONES. Look up the words "Weruva Kitty Gone Wild" and look for my review at the top with photos of the bones. There are several needle sharp pointy bones and large thick jaw bones with blunt tops. Weruva has since placed a different ad for Kitty Gone Wild WITHOUT the ability to leave a review. Please heed my warning. That flavor can cut your cat's digestive tract. Weruva did nothing to make it right, other than to say they "strive for no bones". Stay with chicken recipes and the fish I mentioned and you should be ok. Every now and then please inspect the fish flavors closely in case anything changes in the future.  Please mark this comment as "helpful" so it rises to the top so people can protect their cats. This is so dangerous. I'd hate to see anyone's cat choke or end up with internal bleeding.
1,I can't believe it.  I paid so much money and It is made of cardboard.  It is hard to clean.  It smells nasty inspite of cleaning.  The crystals are horrible for the lungs
1,Maybe your dog is different from mine,but "Peticure Petite Nail Trimmer" scares the hell out of my dog,and I'm chasing him with the product more than I'm using it. The dogs and cats on the commercial most be drugged,or too old to run like my Airedale. I would rather clip my dogs nails instead.
1,We bought the large version, which just wasn't very large.  I know my fault for not checking measurements but still.  Our Golden puppy is a killer of plush toys, so the lack of stuffing was a huge selling point.  Being Kong, we thought it would be tough.  We were wrong.  Our puppy turned it inside-out and removed its squeaker in less than an hour.  We were not impressed at all, nor was she.  She didn't even look at it after she had removed the squeaker.  Some toys she will still play with and drag around, but this one she lost all interest in.
1,did not work
1,My guinea pigs didn't want it. They only want straight timothy hay! I buy Kaytee hay anyway...but I thought I'd give this a try for variety.
1,This ball didn't even last 30 mins with my 45 lb puppy.  Will not recommend.
1,cute design but way too small for what I needed. Back to using a throw rug under the kitty litter box
1,Too small for my pug , measurements are off.
1,When we decided to buy these pads, we read all the reviews. Some 5 stars, others 1 star. Ours is a 1 star because the product is bad. These pads are low quality. We have to clean every time our puppy pees. It does not absorb the pee. We have a 5 pds dachshund (3 months old) and with a single pee we have to replace the pad. Good luck to you.
1,This doesn't work well for my pitbull. I had better luck using the Kong brush for his short hair.		<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/KONG-ZoomGroom-Dog-Grooming-Brush-Boysenberry/dp/B0002AR19Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">KONG ZoomGroom, Dog Grooming Brush, Boysenberry</a>
1,I could smell the product. It was mild. Cat didn't respond at all. She is a friendly, sweet cat.
1,I strongly advise against feeding this food to your rabbit. Domestic pet rabbits do not eat seeds and they are detrimental to their health. They should not ingest them.  Rabbit pellets and hay is the preferred feed for domestic pet rabbits. This feed could cause intestinal distress in your pet.
1,Light broke quickly
1,Not enough food, lots of liquid.
1,This large diffuser demand higher pressure than average yeast DIY CO2 generators give. You might try a smaller version. I haven't tried a smaller version yet. However, I would not try one because it doesn't look nice in my tank.	Another thing is that the diffuser does not stay straight against the wall. The connector to the suction cup does not hold the diffuser strongly.	Another design complaint is that the connector to the tube is pointing downwards. Thus, the hose should be bent. The diffuser has a guide holder for the tube, in fact, to which you insert the tube. But, in my case, then, the tube didn't stay straight leaning towards the wall.
1,i bought this chicken jerky two times. the first purchase, the jerky was okay, nothing special a little hard but i managed to break it in smaller pieces. i have two small dogs and they like jerky. anyway the second purchase was a waste of $25...the product was so hard i couldn't cut it or break it. since i didn't have any other treats on hand i soaked a few pieces in water....not jerky any more....jerky this  hard  can not be  healthy and a larger dog would reduce it to splinters,,,yes it was that hard.. needless to say i won't waste any more money on this product.
1,This motor is just like the original except that it is quite loud and sounds like it will break soon and has been like this since the instant I installed it.
1,These are somewhat useful but I found some rubber-maid sink liners that work better.  The problem with these is they will prevent water from draining unless you cut a hole in them and the hole (drain) is what I was trying to cover up so that little poodle boy doesn't stick his foot in the drain.
1,Truly disappointed with my order. I ordered two tall plants April 13th and received them today, April 18th. I was very very excited seeing all the wonderful reviews of this product. I have a 20 gallon and I was planning on using these as a background plant, which is why I opted for the larger size because they were supposed to be 8" tall. I opened the box and was already upset becaus there was no insulation, just a plastic bag with the plants in it, and I could already see significant browning and melting of leaves. The first plant barely reaches 6" with quite a few dead leaves in the middle. The second is around 7" (which is better) but has tons of browning and dead leaves. They both have a weird growth on their leaves, possibly snail eggs? I'm not sure. I had really high hopes for this, and I don't think I would buy from this seller again. Maybe I was unlucky and got a bad batch, because the customer review pictures were gorgeous. But either way this was a let down and I don't know if I'm even going to put them in my tank.	Attached are pictures of the plants the day I received them. The last shot is the best picture I could get of the growth that's all over the leaves.
1,I bought this trimmer and used it literally once per month on two dogs for small areas and touch-ups. After six months the battery would simply not recharge enough to allow me to use it for more than 8-10 minutes at a time. In other words after a dozen short periods (15-20 minutes each) of usage the battery will not recharge properly. That is appalling. It is a nice trimmer and would be quite useful if it worked properly. I have tried to get some joy out of Oster but they keep telling me that nothing can be wrong or send it - at my cost - into a service center for a month or two. What good is that? Use a trimmer for 6 months - service it for two?
1,Don't bother. After paying $23 and slowly breaking the plastic that "locks" the 2 sides together, we realized that we could just cut a flap in our screen door and it would leave just the same amount of bug coverage as as a door. It's not like the cat door does anything except make the cats push open a heavyish door anyways...no security or anything added.		It's fine, but just think about it in case that would work for you too.
1,My guy is 72 lbs.  I gave him the recommended amount and there was no noticeable change, upped his dosage, still no noticeable change.  Loved that is was all natural, but my dog is very high energy and our vet recommended medication.  It may be they were just not right for my guy.
1,Already stale when arrived.
1,you see that big dog in the photo... this product is barely chihuahua sized... WHO knows the measurement around the dog? they should have it listed by pounds or at least by S M L.  so small.
1,This was a disappointment.  Although it fit my dog well, the black ending around the harness has completely come apart after just a few weeks of wear.  It happened just after my window to return the product:(
1,Nothing wrong with Seachem in general; many of their products are great. However this one is a big waste of money.		I agree with others who have said that baking soda will do pretty much the same thing for a fraction of the price. They must be making a killing on this one.
1,We would like it a lot more if the magnet was strong enough to keep it on the fridge.
1,Had to return this one it was loud and leaked...the seal didn't seem to be installed properly ...go with a fluval
1,I am an avid hunter and I take my Lab with me quite often. I bought this so I could keep the bowls in my backpack and take it out when needed. It worked fine for a few hunts and then it started leaking water. When filled up, the water will leak out in only a few minutes. Now I am just taking a tupperware container that I can fill up with water... Far easier and cheaper.
1,We just found a HUGE hunk of mold (like bigger than my fist) in our bag of Taste of the Wild food. Our dog has been having issues with diarrhea and blood in her stool (including a trip to the emergency vet one night after she vomitted). The vet said the bacteria in her stool was off and sent us with some antibacterial/anti inflammatory meds for her GI Tract. That was a couple of weeks ago. We just dumped the rest of her bag into her food bin and found this HUGE chunk of mold! Looked it up on google and apparently people have been having this same issue for years. Stop feeding your dogs this!! :(  http://germanshepherdhome.net/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/250696/Mold_in_Taste_of_the_Wild_dog_
1,Smaller than stated in description
1,Unfortunately, from time to time I get a male cat that has been neutered. They have ALWAYS had UTI problems eventually. So I thot I would try this as  currently I have a cat w/ this problem. First let me say, all three of my cats love these.......which surprised me. BUT..........I think it created another problem.....the two of the cats stopped pooping for 4 & 5  days! So now I had another problem which wasn't a problem before! So I stopped giving these tabs and started w/ the laxatone.....I think slowly we're getting back to 'normal'. I probably won't use these OR if I do......it will be occasionally and not daily, which probably won't do any good.
1,That is inaccurate...just because I give it one of five stars, I don't "hate it" but my cats do...(they gave it one paw.) The catzen tend to spew all of the selections sent via Catamazon Prime but they love the same stuff from the neighborhood grocery.  Don't blame me...I do not eat the stuff and I asked the catzen:  they won't either!!
1,My 5 mo old puppy loved this but with in literally 5 min he had it chewed up the plastic is very flimsy, But it was a cheap toy so i guess you get what you paid for.
1,Hmmm.....the dog one worked better than this one did to remove the urine smell and stains. Not sure why. Will not buy again.
1,Much smaller than the dimensions given
1,It would've been nice if I had realized the clamps won't fit over your average aquarium plastic rim, I can't imagine getting it on anything that's not rimless.... Luckily I have eggcrates as a top so for now it just sits on top pointed down, unattached from anything
1,Stairs are very narrow.  My 5.5 lbs. chi/terrier mix doesn't like it.  Plus, the very edge of the stairs is where you need the most tread, but is not covered by the stick-on felt it came with.  My dog NOT feel secure on this thing.  I will have to glue some felt on the edges now.  Don't really recommend it.
1,Beware - These are literally smaller than a double A battery... total choking hazard for any dog over 5 lbs.
1,It looks durable but my yorkie had in torn up in minutes.  Waste of time and money.  I paid 3.99 at Menards.
1,My dog doesn't respond to any frequency of this whistle. And I'm pretty sure the one I received was used. I hope I don't get mouth herpes from a used whistle. Gross.
1,This sucks for large dogs. Aside from my dog just not being interested, I don't even see the point of this. You can't really put treats anywhere without the dog just nosing it away and getting the treats right off the floor. Anything else is better.
1,Got this only used it for a few days. The flakes are very messy.  Is reccomend getting the pellets
1,Definitely not made for larger breed dogs even when they are still pups.  Tore the ears of very quickly.
1,4 dogs that eat ANYTHING won't touch them
1,Best flea prevention ever! 8 months no worries. I have 5 of them. Highly recommended!	Price is way to much! Looking elsewhere.
1,Just learned that this company has been bought out by purina!!!  Money was more important, than the pets I guess.  Purina has changed the formula, the bags are now 25 lbs, instead of 30.  Did some research, and have ordered a food named "Wellness Core" a 5 star food with no recalls.  Some of my information came from "pet advisor they usually provide good information.  The cost of organix is also going up.  The cost of Wellness Core, is about the same as the old prices of Organix.  I hate losing this food my dogs did so good on it, will update after I have used a bag of the new food.
1,Unfortunately this hasn't worked for me. I will say the furbo customer service was EXCELLENT though. They did really help to try to fix the problems I was having and even sent me a new furbo to replace the one I had that wasn't working. My problem was I couldn't get it to connect to my router. I actually have 3 routers. One is 5ghz and the others are 2.4. This will only work with 2.4. After spending a few hours trying to get it to connect on my own and then with customer service, we weren't able to fix the issue. I received the replacement very few quickly. However I had the same issue with the new one. I was eventually able to get it to connect with my oldest router which is really just a back up. It's old and doesn't have much range so it was useless for this. Had I been using this in close proximity to that router it would prob work fine but there is no good spot to keep my dog near that router. Comcast even tried to get it to connect to my other routers but they weren't successful. It seems like a great thing had I been able to use it properly. The customer service with furbo really was top knotch though so I'm confident if anyone else encounters a problem, it will be taken care of quickly. Unfortunately I'll be returning one to Amazon and the other one back to Furbo.
1,Turned moldy in the bag
1,~It was torn apart w/n an hour by my pom~
1,UPDATE 07/2016- The finer dust like particles make me hate this stuff. I didn't rinse it really because it was supposed to come seeded with live bacteria and rinsing in tap water would have killed off any bacteria. So basically, when it comes time to turn this (I usually stir it once every few weeks because it WILL get pockets of air and bacteria as it's packed tight) the finer stuff just gets EVERYWHERE and typically clogs my mini siphon. I have finally rescaped the last tank to house this type of substrate and all I can say is good riddance. Regular sand with some root tabs has worked out significantly better.	The ONLY reason this doesn't have 5 stars is because I didn't know ahead of time that it wasn't really dark black, and that it would slightly fade over time. However, I love this stuff. Finer material really does settle, and it makes planting much easier. A little goes a long way. This definitely covered the bottom of my 30 gallon tank. I wanted a little deeper substrate though for my aquascaping design, so I mixed it with Black Flourite Sand. The larger pieces of this substrate still found their way on top and it looks stunning.	Cycle was pretty short, and the plants are all very happy. Would purchase again.
1,As for size this thing is huge and perfect for those wanting to cover their entire seat and create a barrier to the front seat. The only complete let down is the "non-slip" surface. There are only three strips that create the non-slip surface which are only maybe 4" wide. With leather seats they don't stick at all and you end up with essentially a loose blanket on your seat as your dog slides back and forth. Due to this one flaw I will be forced to look at other options because my giant breed dog bunches the seat cover up because of how easy it slips around which easily causes the seat to be exposed again.
1,I read many of the reviews of this Filter and decided to get it for my overstocked 75 gallon African cichlid tank... well the first two days were fine after a simple assembly and startup. Tonight I heard a sound after I shut the tv off for the night and found that this filter was emitting a medium pitch whine constantly. I played with the valves and it can be lessened with less flow...sooooo I am pretty pissed that I seem to have gotten a bad unit. I am annoyed that now I have to tear it out and send it back. I had planned to add a second canister and today ordered a eheim here on amazon to be the partner to this Penn Plax filter...so when that arrives it will take over the duties while I send this crap back to amazon and probably get another eheim or Fluval......IF the noise goes away in a couple days I will modify my review....
1,Followed the instructions. The bug only held the first charge for about 30 seconds. Wouldn't charge at all after that. Returned it to the store where I bought it and got another one. It had the same problem. The bug is a good design and my cats are interested in it but the mechanics are terrible.
1,We found that it has to be very tight on her neck just below her head to function, because it has to push against her vocal chords to actually feel their vibration when she barks. So it has to be very tight indeed otherwise it doesn't work. So much that after a day of trying it still had not showed any effect and we were going to return... because it was not tight enough.
1,I didn't like this.  I returned this after I got it.  My dog didn't like it either.  I got this when he was a 2 month old puppy.  It did absolutely nothing, he's a Lab.  It wasn't strong enough to clip his nails and I was just sitting there with that whirling noise going on.  I just got him those regular dog nail clippers instead that cost $3, those work just fine.  It arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping, and the return and refund was very easy and no headaches.
1,While I have no complaints about how this is built- it seems to be well constructed but for some reason not one of my 4 cats will go near it.  I have another cat tree that they all love and use daily that I have on my back porch but needed one for indoors so, I got this one. I don't know if it's the materials/odor they don't like or what it is about it but they won't touch it. Wish I could return it but, already threw the box away thinking they would love it as much as my other one. Wrong!  It is well built and exactly as pictured so, no complaints on that- maybe your cats will like it!
1,We've had a good experience with this harness for a few months. Earlier today though, while on a walk, our dog (60lb of eagerness and excitement) saw another dog down the street and tryied to lunge on its direction. The ring on the chest plate, where the leash connects to the harness, ripped out of the harness,and our dog ran out towards the other dog.  Fortunately, our dog is just excited to see and meet other dogs AND the other dog was on the same ride of a busy street. In many other circumstances, this could have ended tragically. I'm assuming the lifetime warranty comes into play here given that an essential part of the harness came apart during standard operation. Will update post once I learn more.
1,NOT AS EXPECTED
1,I did not order this product, I ordered the dog food!  If you quit outsourcing, maybe you'd get more competent employees
1,They didn't do anything for my dog's stomach issues
1,Just received my second shipment of 120 dead crickets. This shipment was sent by Josh's Frogs to replace a previous dead shipment. No hot pack in box. One container bottom up even tho box says to keep upright. I'm very disappointed as this is the only way I can get crickets for my chameleon. Must find new source even though I will have to buy more than I need somewhere else.
1,I have been using this for almost a year and have seen no results whatsoever. Very disappointed. I now have to spend $350 on teeth cleaning for my dog.
1,I love the idea of all this kitty stuff and it definitely appeals to my desire to spoil my cats however... this is not all it's cracked up to be.  Gum massager?  You've gotta be kidding me.  My cats just lick around the so-called "gum massager" in order to try and eat the catnip.  The only usual part is the comb on the base but there's much better options for that anyways.. So if you're looking for advice from me.. I'd say save your money and try something else.
1,I have three cats: a 3 year old female and two 2-1/2 year old males. One of the males is extremely playful, the other is extremely lazy, and the female falls in the middle. I'm always on the lookout for toys they'll love--especially ones that will get the lazy cat moving. I thought this product had potential. Unfortunately, my cats were less than enthralled.		Here's how our experience with the product went: I installed the batteries (3 AA--not included), turned on the switch, and set the toy down near my cats. The squeaking startled them at first, but they eventually came over to investigate. After staring for a couple minutes, the female tentatively batted at one of the mice. Then the playful male tried to bite one. Finally, the lazy male halfheartedly swatted at one of the mice. After about five minutes, they all walked away ... and I turned off the toy, as the squeaking was about to drive me batty!		Hands down, my favorite toy purchase is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/OurPets-Original-Play-N-Squeak-MouseHunter-Interactive-Cat-Toy/dp/B001HWF2W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">OurPets Original Play-N-Squeak MouseHunter Interactive Cat Toy</a>--which is put out by Our Pets, the same company that makes the Hide and Go Squeak. For the same amount of money, you could buy six of those mice for your cats ... and you'll get a lot more play out of them than you will out of this product. (We're on our third mouse in about a year--my cats carry them all over the house, bat them around, and pull out the fur. They LOVE them.) Our Pets has such a winner in the Play-N-Squeak. I wish I could say the same about the Hide and Go Squeak, but I can't. I doubt it will see much more play time in our house.
1,My dogs hated these.  I abandoned them --one by one-- at the park.  Not quality.
1,Didn't seem to do anything for my baby. Won't buy again.
1,I bought this XL vest for a medium size GSD.  I got it on his feet.  No way would it fit him.  Gave it to my sister for her beagle.
1,This dog food was recalled. Our dog spent a week in the hospital. It all started with her not eating this food. We thought she was going on a hunger strike. I mixed in some pumpkin and she ate the food. She threw up. We thought she was having stomach issues. We decided to switch to the Blue Buffalo Salmon. We were mixing 1/4 cups Salmon with 3/4 cup white fish and sweet potato to transition her off. She was throwing up violently and had diarrhea. We took her to emergency care and she was admitted to the hospital on and off for a week. They did x-rays and and ultrasound and found no foreign bodies. They said it was something she ate. Amazon was nice enough to give us a heads up that the food we bought had been recalled. I called Blue Buffalo and they were on the defense with canned answers. "we are not vets" "there is no proof our dog food made your dog sick" they said there is nothing they can do to help. After $4000 in vet bills and our dog who is 2 years old is still on meds after almost a week and can't hold her pee.
1,I don't know why but my horse licked this off his leg which was really strange for him.
1,The top caves in with very little pressure.  The cats aren't interested in it.  The wood inside is very splintery.  Not please with this at all.  Plus, the cat shreds my rug with her claws, totally ignoring the carpeted outside of this thing.
1,Junk no power in flow very small unit
1,I purchased 3 toys.  2 of the 3 were returned because the squeakers were bad... The one I gave her, my dog (corgi / border collie mix) had this torn apart and the stuffing all over the house... it's feet torn off and it head and ears within half hour of giving this to her... I would not recommend!
1,Not sure if it helped or not
1,Super small! And our guinea pig hates the mat.
1,I thought this thing worked great for the price, but have noticed today that the plastic on two of the trays is disintegrating. That's horrible and I'm worried about my turtle's health with all of that crap having been in the water. Buying a different brand and will never ever touch SunSun again.
1,I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly, because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison, but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward, I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones.
1,Buy the clump and seal in the green box instead
1,My 2 cats like playing with it, but there are 2  major flaws. First there is no timing mechanism, so once you turn it on it stays on until you manually turn it off. It needs to automatically turn off after 15-20 minutes because, leading to problem 2...it eats batteries like crazy. You'll get 3 play sessions at most per set of batteries. It takes 3 "C" cells.
1,My dog escaped from this harness on the 2nd time he wore it  The fabric and construction is nice, very comfortable, but easy to slip out of.  Thank god we hadn't got out to the street yet!  I also think they tend to run a little large.
1,waste of money - my dog shredded it in seconds had to go to the veterinarian because he ate it!!!!!!!
1,This had no effect on the cats.  I can tell the difference because the spray version did. Waste of money.
1,This stuff is gross. And incredibly expensive. When I rehydrated the food, it looked and smelled awful. But I'm not a cat, so I figured I'd let my two 12-year-old felines check it out. Not surprisingly, they didn't want anything to do with it. They both took a couple of sniffs, turned their noses up at it, and walked away. I tried giving it to them two other times, too, and got the exact same reaction. Now, I realize that it's entirely possible that your cat(s) may actually eat and enjoy this food. But at more than six bucks an ounce, do you really want to take that chance???
1,I bought this to avoid making my self (as the process takes about 6 hours to dry the egg shells), but it did not work as the homemade egg shells do. I powder it and give it to my female dogs after they have puppies and while nursing for calcium support. When I used this product, over the dried egg shells made at home, very little calcium was absorbed. In fact so little was absorbed she had to be rushed the the emergency vet having severe eclampsia requiring and IV drip of calcium. The dog has taken other egg shell calcium and not had any calcium issues with previous pregnancies so it is most likely this product and not my dog's condition. Giving the second star as it may not be the company's fault as it did use it off label; but dog breeders be where this is not an acceptable substitute for the egg shell calcium you use.
1,This lasted longer than most toys, but she finally chewed through it.  Only hard bones and men's socks (really!) survive her chewing.
1,These perches fell apart!  The hardware fell out and scared my birds.  I am disappointed with the quality of this product!
1,my pit bull prefers the other chrome wire sunglasses over these because... these seem to be a bit bulky an less air flow and blockage of perifial vision than the other wire rimmed sunglasses that doggles makes the ones that look more like human sunglasses versus these that look like human under water goggles. I would defiantly go with the other human looking sunglasses that doggles sell over these type but these are good for a dog that would be riding on a motorcycle nothing other than that and for a pit bull the best goggle type sunglasses you can get are these which are the ILS versus the original because the originals are more narrow at the nose and the ILS are more spread out at the nose and we all know pit bulls have wider noses and heads so these would be your best bet for goggle doggles and will fit perfect but even better than this for a pit bull are the chrome wired sunglasses that look similar to pancho from the old tv show chips the 2 motor cycle cops from the 70s hope this info helps
1,My Doberman cracked it within the first 3 days.
1,40-60 gallon divider, yeah right.	I searched for 60 gallon separator and was offered this 40-60 gallon separator.	What showed up was a 40 gallon breeder separator. 40 gallon breeders are the short 40s with a lot of floor area for breeding.	I would have to lower the water in my 60 gal by at least 6 inches to get the water level down to the top. At that point the hang on back filter most likely will not work an a lot of money in fish would die.	On a 55 gal you would have to go at least 3 inches low.
1,The box stated that this toy had two speeds.  When I received it there was only one speed slow.  I had new batteries in it and there was no second speed.  There was a position for it, but there was no upped speed whatsoever.  The slow speed did nothing for my cats, they caught the string and sat there with it in there mouths.  It is very flimsy made, and I was very disappointed.  So, I sent it back.  Then the company said that the box was damaged, but not by me, then they were not very nice about me returning it.  Amazon stepped in and authorized the return, but I would not buy this again, nor will I deal with this company again.  Amazon is a great company, good thing they were there to back this purchase up.  I cannot understand how this toy got the awards that the box said it did........
1,Too small I ordered a large. Doesn't work
1,Ordered 2 and both came broken...returned
1,Worked for awhile and next door neighbor's dog not continually barking.  Then, put in fresh batteries because it stopped working.  Nothing.  Dog is now barking like before.  Fresh batteries in, nothing appears wrong with unit and it tests out.  But dog is no longer deterred. I think dogs get used to the sound it emits (heard only by dogs and not humans) and then it is no longer effective.  I would not recommend because dogs (at least the chronic barking one next door to me) seem to get used to it. I tried another similar device that was more expensive and - nothing.  Hint: This type of stuff works for a very short time on a dog then the dog gets used to it.  Also, these are not as water resistant as is claimed.  After a hard rain ours has water in it and of course, that impeded it working.  I don't think much of these types of products.
1,On paper, this sounds like a great product for dog owners -- hook the arrow onto the sling, pull it back, and launch it through the air like an arrow. Instruction and illustrations on the back show you how to use it, so there shouldn't be any confusion. In actuality, the execution is a dismal failure.		The packaging touts "designed to fly", but the problem is, it doesn't. The dart is way too heavy to be aerodynamic, and it usually hits the handle or my hand before becoming airborne. Instead of spinning through the air like a bullet, it kind of flops inelegantly end over end. You can see this in ChuckIt's own video at 14 seconds in.		You're better off just throwing the dart yourself. I couldn't get it to go more than 20 ft with the launcher. Avoid this piece of junk.
1,Being kittens, my little ones like to scratch furniture and occasionally their humans. After looking into what all is involved in declawing a cat I decided to look for alternatives as the surgery required to declaw a kitten seems inhumane, in my own personal opinion. My boyfriend and I were very excited to find a product that would allow the cats to keep their claws and us to keep our furniture looking decent, win-win right?		The claw covers were put on almost as soon as the package was delivered to our front door. They went on easy enough. I had recently trimmed the kittens nails, but this was a different ball game all together. We did as some reviewers suggested, applied a few and give them a rest and continue a bit later.		The problems started within the first hour. One of the kittens got stuck in the area rug. The rug being looped got caught around the the claw cover causing my little one to be stuck to the carpet. Luckily for him, we were in the living room. After the second time he became tangled I decided to check to see if this was a common problem or simply due to my inexperience in the application of the soft paws. It turns out that this is a common problem. This to me is completely and absolutely unacceptable. Had I not been playing with him on that area rug it is possible that I would not have known about this issue and left him for 8+ hours while I go to work to return home to an injured kitten or possibly even still immobilized.		While the idea seems to be a fantastic one, I simply cannot endorse an item that has the potential to seriously injury my furry babies. I would much prefer to deal with the occasional scratch and spend more time training them not to scratch the furniture than to use these items ever again.
1,These are not the real deal. She hated them. Had to microwave them just to make it into something she might chew. Went back to the Himalayans.
1,The looked like they would work, the medium were way too small for both my corgis. I figured large would be too large.  I tried a few times to mush their feet into it and all that happened was they came right off when they walked.
1,I would give this zero stars if I could. This product is proven to cause harm to the animals that it is used on. Visit http://www.hartzvictims.org for stories of the effects of this product.
1,Based upon measurements, it doesn't fit. It's too big and pup can't walk or go potty if he wanted since it covers it up. If I down sized, it would be too small.
1,Unfortunately this didn't work for my lab mix.  He pulled a ton and this only helped minimize the pull.  We moved on to an easy walk harness which worked much better.
1,I purchased this for my Bronze Winged Pionus.  I have purchased this before without a single problem so imagine my surprise when I put a 1/4 cup in his feed dish, turned away for second or two and when I turned back... his dish was filled with little bugs.  It was gross, it was disgusting.  The bag was NOT out of expiration.  So it must not have been stored correctly for that to have happened.  Zupreme Avian Entrees are being discontinued by the company and I was so happy to have found this bag as it's Apollo's favourite one and then this.  Never, never purchase again.
1,Did not fit the way it was supposed to.
1,My dog wasn't the biggest fan of these treats.
1,i could not clip my large dog's nails.....  i sent it back... not strong enough;  dremel works the BEST
1,I had no idea it was the size of a ping pong ball.  It was a choking hazard so I couldn't let my dog play with it.
1,What I got is not what was pictured. I have 2 yorkies that I usually give the mini Dingo bones to. I thought I would try these so they would last longer. What I got were bone shaped rawhide 'bones'  They can't even get them started. I would retuen them but they are both already open.
1,I realize this is supposed to have the same active ingredients as more expensive brands. However my own personal experience hasn't been great after 2 months of application with this less costly alternative. It just flat out hasn't performed well at all. Weve been battling fleas in our home for the past 2 flea seasons now, but when we applied Advantage products we noticed the cats HAD NO FLEAS for about a month. There may have still been some in the house, but Advantage kept them off our pets entirely, no scratching, none on the flea comb, nothing. PetArmor simply doesnt do this. The very next day & every day after, the cats have a few visible fleas on them & they're scratching. This is very disappointing, especially considering how much less this stuff costs. Who knows, maybe we got a couple bad batches, but so far not so good.
1,my cat's refused to eat any food with this stuff on it, from smelling it I don't blame them.  I'm sticking with a non flavored probiotic.
1,It's very oily and leaves a noticeable residue on my dog's fur. You could see where the medication was administered and petting him left a residue on your hand.  Frontline didn't have these issues but I've switched to nextguard and I'll never go back!
1,The clippers came with a defect.  I am not able to get a clean cut with these clippers.  The blade is not sharp. It looks like the blade was damaged during manufacturing.  Whenever I use these, my cats claws are torn up. Would have exchanged for a sharp pair since the design is excellent but I threw away the packaging the day it arrived.
1,This product is not cost competitve to ship. Probably the only item not worth purchasing on amazon and i am someone who purchases everything on  amazon.
1,This was a suck for me I put it on and it only work one night in the morning it didn't turn on no more so I got stuck with no bulb really sad because it's a little  spensive for it only to work few hours: (
1,They love the flavor but don't work woth mine
1,The tank looks nice, but the filter is AWFUL.  You have to remove the entire thing to change the cartridge (so, look at the product pic, and you have to remove that whole brown box on top).  It's a messy ordeal.  Often when one then promptly plugs the filter back in it won't work.  It seems to have to "rest" for 30 minutes or so before working.  The lights are fine - very little light output and they get dirty fast and are tough to clean.  I had to get a dish brush to do it that I only use on the tank.  Because it's open top it evaporates very fast, though i knew that when I got it. Be sure to either arrange for someone to add water when you are gone on a vacation of more than 4 days or buy the hood which is sold separately.  I've had the unit about a year now and the water got low when we went out of town for 5 days and the filter broke.  My own fault, but I've been disappointed by it the whole time.
1,This is for the JW "Megalast Long Dog Toy". I love JW products but not this one. We have a 90 lb German Shepherd Dog that has a squeaky compulsion. He's not destructive, he doesn't try to tear his toys apart, he just squeaks them until the squeakers die which JW toys usually take a week or so to do (other brands tend to die after an hour if we're lucky). This one, though, is designed wrong. The tube shape is too narrow, it doesn't allow for enough air to be pushed through to get a good squeak so our boy decided it must be a chew toy. That's when I confiscated and trashed it.
1,FOULS THE WATER NO MATTER HOW SMALL AN AMOUNT I USE.
1,i purchased the 2 port model to power a generic 3" round air stone and the ViaAqua 12in 2.7 watt Blue & White LED Light & Airstone. Both stones combined fell well within the pumps capabilities.  The side pumping to the ViaAqua is dead.  I switched the lines thinking it was the airstone, but as soon as i plugged in the pump it was obvious i have a defective pump. Disgusted i left the bad side on the 3" round stone and it won't push one bubble out of it in my 20 gal tank.  The working side is still going strong for now.....  Still debating if it's worth the hassle of returning.  Won't buy ever again.
1,My pup got killed cause this pen door doesn't stay secure
1,Cute and a good size for my cat.  Questionable product quality, though.  When the bowl arrived I cleaned it and served wet food in it to my cat.  The next day I was cleaning the bowl when I was wiping it down it turned up black residue!  At first I thought it might have had something to do with the food, but the residue persisted even after cleaning and wiping it down several times.		After two weeks of use/cleaning I don't seem to get black smears anymore.  But the only reason I'm not replacing the bowl for safety concerns is because I did some Googling and found that sometimes stainless steel products come with residue from the polishing process during manufacture, which allegedly isn't harmful.  If the smears come back, though, I will be replacing this product.
1,I had a small problem with one of the flaps not closing properly. I called Ideal Pet Products and spoke with a gentleman there, who said I should submit a warranty claim for a new outside frame. So I submitted the claim, and it was REJECTED. Why? Because I bought the door through Amazon Warehouse Deals (a product that had been returned to Amazon). The complete lack of customer support, and the company's utter contempt for its customers, leads me to recommend that you look elsewhere for a dog door.		UPDATE: Not only is the company's customer service HORRIBLE, to add insult to injury the outer plastic piece has turned from white to an awful shade of yellow. I've only had it for a year, and now It looks terrible against my white door. Do yourself a favor, DO NOT buy this door. Spend your money elsewhere.
1,When I went to dump all the litter in a big bag and pour in fresh, first I had to clean out 2 gooey mountains stuck to the bottom.  I have the Omega Paw (covered litter box that you roll and all the clumps fall into a basket so you can throw them out without scooping -- I HIGHLY recommend it), but these had never emptied, and even though I rolled and de-clumped weekly I never saw them.  But my cat all of a sudden started going...elsewhere. I guess she could feel them.  On the plus side, the scent is nice and the odor after use is brief.  But I'm done with Arm & Hammer litter.
1,I have a shitzu yorkie mix and he completely ignores this or doesn't hear it, I have tried using it for the ridiculous barking he does at imagined sounds, or when one of my kids enters my bedroom, and you would swear he never knew my kids for the past 4 years...	I was going to throw mine in the  trash, but maybe I will try it again since a lot of reviewers say it works well for them. when my dog barks because the next door neighbors dogs are up at 6 am barking, I find the best thing for me to do is close the .window and instant quietness.
1,This is too small for a betta fish. I know it seems counterintuitive but most pet stores and suppliers are misinformed about bettas. Learn about betta fish and their care from breeders and enthusiasts (like the Nippy Fish site), NOT sellers. To dispel some common myths about bettas:		- They do not live in small dirty puddles in the wild. The recommended tank size is 5+ gallons. They need at LEAST 1 gallon, and 2.5 gallons and up is much better.	- They shouldn't be with or near other bettas unless breeding.	- They are carnivores and need carnivore fish food. They do not eat plants, and they shouldn't eat dried pellets, flakes or freeze-dried food, which bind them up.	- They need heated water (75-80).	- They need a clean tank just like every other fish.	- A single betta with the correct supplies for living by itself will cost about $100. Or it can live in a larger aquarium with certain types of other fish.		Hope that helps!
1,Our dog devoured this in a day.  Needless to say, she was throwing chunks of this and for a couple days had chunks of it in her poop.  I really like the regular Nylabone Flexi-Chews and it takes my dogs months to nibble those down.  Unfortunately, we can't buy this again.
1,DO NOT BUY!!		My 50lb doodle became extremely ill after eating one of these rawhide bones wrapped with chicken jerky. There is a reason that many treats from China are being recalled... this is not a coincidence - he had nothing else out of the ordinary the day he became so sick. PLEASE do not give these (or any other jerky treats) to your beloved pet. I am so lucky this didn't kill him like so many dogs we are hearing about now following the recall. Save yourself huge vet bills and save your sweet animal from suffering. Choose something else that is made in USA and does not contain jerky or any kind.
1,Waste of money.  My GSD punctured this within 10 minutes of my giving to him. It is now nothing but pieces of floppy, red rubber.  Never again.
1,Worthless! My 2 year old colt destroyed it in less than 24 hr.  Followed directions to the letter - inflated correctly and measured- even tho the pump provided is cheap and takes forever...Don't know if a cover would have helped - but if they recommend one, why isn't it just included?  Complete waste of money!  Unless the intended use is decoration DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Bad leader dog has no defense at all my was attacted 125 red doby mu boy was 6 mouths.	My Dog Was not hurt excepted mentally Im not using at all.
1,The cats only like the ones with the soft center, so all of these "dental cleaners' are out.
1,This box is great in theory. I have a problem with the one I have as the slide-locking tabs don't all lock in place. So when I roll the box I always get litter on the floor. I can't figure out why it won't slide shut and lock in place. I just know that when I roll the box I have to hold the lid and base together so nothing spills out.		I thought I'd give it a try for a few weeks to see if I could live with it. UPS delivered the box but it took ages for them to do so, not the shippers fault, and I didn't want to have to deal with them again.		Now I've missed my opportunity for an exchange by literally a few days. I like the box overall but don't want to have to pay for another one.		The instructions on how to put it together aren't really that clear, I took way too long figuring out how it works.
1,If I could give negative stars, that's how I'd rate this.		The contents of the cans are so loose that the cans slosh when shaken.  It can be poured out of the can as a gruel.  It is not a can of solid dog food that comes out in chunks.  It gets lapped up like a thick soup.  It also gave both my dogs terrible gas.		I tried two cases of this same brand and flavor, and the cans in both were the same very disappointing consistency.  Amazon was great in response to my complaint, refunding me the price of the full case without requiring the remainder to be returned to them.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the rest of the cans...
1,I have the world's pickiest eater Shih Tzu, and he will eat these. I buy so many dog foods and treats, trying to get him to eat that it's a tad exciting to find one he doesn't turn up his nose at. I give his rejects to my son's dogs who will eat anything they're offered. Some of the chunks are large, and I just cut them up. They're clean, don't smell too strong, and there's not a huge amount of leftover dust in the bottom of the bag. This is my third purchase.	I dropped 3 stars because the latest bag is unusable. I always cut the large pieces up for my dog, but many of these are hard as a rock and have needle-sharp bones sticking out of them. I was able to return them, but Im afraid to try them again.
1,This is not water proof as described, one accident went completely through all layers to the cushioning. Very disappointed.
1,cat would not drink either with my strays
1,I wanted our cats to love this fountain.  What I really loved about it is that it is ceramic and easy to clean.  The fountain is loud and not at all soothing!  Our cats were afraid of it.  I also think they didn't like the base.  It is not wide enough for a cat to drink out of.  This leaves the water running down the sides or bubbling from the top of the fountain to drink from.  Neither of our cats even tried to drink from it.  I thought if I gave it a few days they might start using it, but all they did was stop drinking water.  So, it's back to the plastic water fountain for them & I'll be returning it.
1,Extremely small like big enough for hamster not small bunny or dog
1,This is not durable enough to leave with our 10lb chihuhua/daschund during the day, as after watching him play with it in the evening he will begin to gnaw on it and break chunks of plastic off! which I then need to take out of his mouth, terrible! This is good for supervised use ONLY.
1,When I first bought this food I absolutely loved it and so did the cats. I bought this brand because the ingredients were very good. Didnt have brewers rice as the first ingredient or corn, a big plus for me. I ended up recommending this food to a lot of my friends and family for both dogs and cats. Until one day my cats, Bella, threw up. I thought it was weird because neither one of my cats have ever been sick. I kept the cats from going onto my patio in case this was caused by a plant. She was still getting sick and stopped eating altogether so I took her to the vet. The vet prescribed some different food and some meds. She got better and started eating her yummy canned food. Once I switched her back to Wilderness she immediately got sick again. I figured she might just need different food but I didn't want to throw Wilderness away because it was a new bag. So I gave the other cat Charlotte Wilderness and kept Bella on some new food. Charlotte started throwing up about a week later. Thats when I realized it was the food and stuck them both on the new food. About a month later Bella caught pneumonia and had to stay the night at the ER or she would have died. The vet told me that it was from throwing up the food, she had inhaled some of her vomit which developed into pneumonia.		I decided to contact Wilderness to prevent all this stress and the piling vet bills from happening to other people. I kept the bag of food expecting them to ask for samples. They never asked for samples, took 10 weeks to review my cats files and said it wasn't their fault. I could not believe they didn't care about whether their food harmed my cat or not. If they had done a thurough investigation then I would feel differently about this situation. Apparently it took so long because they have many other people who have submitted the same complaint. Their emails were rude and provided no helpful information. My vet even told me that there were a lot of issues with this food.		I would highly suggest you look around for a different food. It nearly killed my cat and probably took a few years off my life from stress. Its not worth the $2,000 in vet bills and then to be treated in a rude and unprofessional manner. I am very disappointed in this company.
1,Absolute worthless product. DO NOT BUY! It is 100% waste of $50!		You will be able to hear it clicking and your dog will hear it too, but it will not distract or aid in stopping bad behaviors or barking in any way!		This product should be banned from being sold anywhere for any price!
1,the door broke off. not sturdy at all. too expensive for it to be such cheap quality
1,Turned into crumbs in no time making giving it to my dog difficult. Dog only kind of likes it, not a high motivator for her and super messy for me.
1,Stopped working after a couple months!
1,nice for the price, but the zipper broke first thing..
1,This stuff does not work at all. Please do not waste your money on this product. I hate having to even give it 1 star.
1,Reflective coating attracts dirt and breaks apart quickly.  Bell is on the quieter side.  Cute collar while it's new, but gets ratty fast.
1,We left town for the weekend and set up the feeder only to find out it malfunctioned and our poor cat had no food dispensed.	What a terrible experience, this is not to be relied upon for going out of town use.  We have returned it and never again will by electronic feeder.	we felt like horrible parents to out kitty.
1,Wrong product sent. Product advertised was old formula cedar lemongrass with Hydrated silica which I was specifically looking to buy. What I got is new formula only Lemongrass with SLS Sodium Lauril Sulfate. Not safe for puppies. SLS can irritate skin under certain circumstances.
1,I can't understand why ANYONE would give this post a positive review! I have 5 adult cats and I have several scratching posts in order to keep them from scratching the furniture. THIS IS THE WORST ONE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I received this as a gift as most friends and family know I would rather get a gift for my cats than for me lol! Aside from the fact that this is a very short post, ( Most cats like to stretch as high as they can when scratching), after one cat used it the rope separated leaving a few inches of bare post. Another problem is this post is so light, it leans as if about to fall when the cat used it. I am writing this review because as a cat lover, new owners might see this, the low price, and think it's worth it to buy because you won't loose much money. I wouldn't pay a dollar for this and as a cat lover and a very experienced scratching post buyer, I HIGHLY suggest buying a post that will not only save your furniture but also give your cat pleasure. You can't go just by price. A higher price doesn't always mean higher quality. If you have the room, the best post I have bought is, Midwest Homes for Pets Feline Nuvo Grand Forte Scratching Post. It is huge but the quality is great and a must for multi cat households. Right now it's about $56 on Amazon but the price changes and even if it doesn't, this is a post that will last a long time and well worth the extra money! Kong has a post that is well made if you are looking for a smaller and a bit cheaper post. Trust me, if you have good scratching posts, you will save your furniture and make your cats happy! It's better to shell out $56 at one time than to shell out $20 or $30 every few months! I hope I have given good information for you!
1,This was very cheap, lasted maybe 10seconds. I have a 40lb dog and it tore into shreds and the hair shredded everywhere vs just stuffing coming out. Would not recommend.
1,This is not heavy duty. I don't know what the gauge rating is on the links but they are not what I would consider heavy duty. I ordered this collar for a 90 lbs dog and it seems flimsy for him. I do have a real heavy duty HS prong collar and there is a huge difference.
1,Flimsy construction and lightweight materials. Door latch jammed because of poor construction. Returned for full refund.
1,My Bichon just doesn't seem to like them. I bought these and the greenies on the same day and he really likes the greenies.
1,not what I expected ... simple as that.  Bag was ripped or slit on bottom and there are others out there that do a much better job, IMO.
1,My dachshund loves toys, especially those that make noise.  This Babble Ball appealed to me because it looked like it could live up to his roughness (he tends to destroy toys within minutes), and it was something different than a squeaker toy.		I bought the size recommended on the site for my dog's weight.  When the toy came, he loved it.  Even though it was hard, he was able to get it into his mouth and bring it to me to play fetch.  After a few rounds of fetch, he knocked it around the room.  Again, he loved it.  The sounds were annoying to me, but he loved it so it was fine.		However, about 10 minutes into his playing with it by himself, I noticed that the room was suddenly quiet.  I looked up, and my dog had the toy in his mouth -- stuck there.  There was no danger of it going down his throat -- the ball was too big -- but he got it into his mouth so tightly surrounded by his teeth that he couldn't get the ball out.  He was stuck there looking at me with his mouth wide open and the ball shoved into it.		I immediately ran to him to get it out (which took a few seconds -- it was really stuck), and proceeded to immediately throw the ball in the trash.  I shudder to think how long he may have been like that, mouth wide open with a ball stuck into it, if I hadn't been right there.		So, be very careful with a ball this hard that has no "give" to it.  If it gets firmly into your dog's mouth, they cannot squish down on it to make it smaller to get it out.  I feel like a catastrophe was averted here.
1,A few years ago I used this product to treat for anchor worms and it worked a charm. Got them again so I ordered the same product. I finished treatment two weeks ago but have noticed more worms so starting a new round of treatment. What's going on? If it doesn't work this time I will have to find a new product.
1,Dog loved it for the 2 seconds it worked :(  I have found that all of the multipet 'Look Who's Talking' toys cannot withstand actual dog play.  I wrote the company and they sent me 2 replacements and both of those failed also.  Go with the Deedle Dudes, they seem to have more integrity in their sound box
1,If this spills, it is very sticky, like sugar
1,My cats had them off in a few hours and gave them a good chew, rendering the collars useless.  Not worth a tenth of the money.
1,this is really cute but hard to get on your dog.  and it runs small.  so I returned.  No problem with returns
1,I purchased this tool for my Havanese in 2016 and liked it so much that I bought one for my groomer.  Recently purchased two more: one for the travel bag and one for a gift.  The more recently manufactured comb has fewer teeth and isn't as effective.  I can no longer recommend this dog grooming tool.
1,The seal on this one isn't as good as the others. The top feels much cheaper. Go with the ones with the paw prints on the sides.
1,I was really hoping with all the reviews that these would last.  My dogs immediately found it their personal mission to degut these.  I gave it an extra star just because my dogs are an anomaly.
1,I got this to deshed my two wolfhounds and one corgi mix. it's basically a piece of wood with a dull saw blade on it.	it didn't do any deshedding other than the top coat. for horses, yes I'm sure this would work. for my purpose, awful.	I use traditional horse grooming tools on my dogs and they work much better. returning.
1,not very aesthetically pleasing.
1,Do not buy these.  They are counterfeit. They do not have velcro drip to adjust harness. So harness has to slip over dogs head. Also only have one metal loop to attach leash. These are not Puppia products but are inferior knockoffs
1,This is a really watery cat food, almost like soup. My cats are still hungry after eating this.
1,It gavey puppy loose stools
1,Caution.  The button has gotten stuck ON (& continuously shocks!) at least twice already.  Very frustrating because my dog doesn't make a noise when I give a shock, and so I didn't even notice the button was stuck in and was continuously shocking him until I noticed him cowering down either time.
1,Not very happy, opened box to find a main support tab broken....directions are not clear.  Bar spacing is very large,  my full grown rats can put their heads through the bars.  Expected better from this trusted name...
1,There are other ich and parasite treatments out there, if you are a fish-newb.		This is actually a pretty dangerous treatment for fish if you don't monitor your copper levels.  The instructions say take out all your fish while you're treating it, and to check your copper levels before treatment.  Your fish are really sensitive to this treatment, so expect dead fish if you put it in the water with the fish.		I used this on my tank, following the directions, and I treated it for 4 days (the life of ich is 4 days, so I treated it 4 just to make sure.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.  I bought some different Ich treatment from a fish store and it worked right away with no problems to the health of the fish.		I recommend using another treatment.  If you google this one, you'll learn that it isn't the best---it's pretty archaic.
1,This was good the first couple of times I ordered	It. Recently, though, what I have been receiving in the 25 pound box is half a box of clover and weeds, tightly clumped together, and unable to be spread. I have received at least 6 boxes of garbage at this point- as I was ordering 4 at a time. Will be sourcing local delivery of this because this is unacceptable.
1,IT SAYS ITS FITS MOST CAGES AND I HAVE 2 CAGES BOTH DIFFERENT AND IT DIDNT FIT WITHER ONE OF THEM, I HAVE USED THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS MANY TIMES...THIS ONE IS NOT GOOD
1,I refuse to continue to shop on Amazon.com as long as they sell abusive destructive animal traps that maim and kill.  Jaw, leg hold, steel spring, coil, ANY AND ALL abusive killing animal traps have got to go.  There is NO EXCUSE for selling or using such horrifying products.
1,I purchased 2 of these mats and they started getting holes in them right away.
1,This fits my puppy's body part well but I have to fight and hold him down in order to put his head through since it's too small. Preparing for the walk is not the best time for him.  While walking, it rises and it becomes too tight under his armpits (? does dog have armpits?).
1,My dog hates it. She sniffs it and walks away. Will go almost 2 days without eating.
1,My dog ripped this apart in 2 seconds.
1,My 18 month old lab destroyed this to pieces in less than an hour. Great hour, but what now? Need to improve quality to last longer.
1,I love these harnesses. HOWEVER, they are definitely NOT sized right! I ordered a small and it was HUGE. I sent it back and ordered an XS......still way too big!! I GIVE UP!. Not sending anymore back. Doggles doesn't know how to label their products.
1,These are just bags.
1,It simply doesn't work for my dog.  She hated it.  I found my patience and have gotten much better giving them to her without the aid of a pill gun.
1,Less than an hour and it's stuffing was all over the floor, should not be sold as a dog toy
1,My cats simply ignore this I have sprinkle catnip on it but no takers!
1,This does not hold up well. It is a very sturdy plastic and my dogs were breaking off pieces of it and chewing the plastic- not cool... so it went into the trash. I guess I need something more durable and will keep searching...
1,They smell funny. I has to be a preference thing but I won't buy them again. One thing, they are thick so that's good. I just couldn't stand the smell.
1,Didnt last two days.., but my Africa Grey had fun tearing it up.  With 'scrap wood' and hardware purchase this can be made for about $3.00.
1,The company has been great about replacing those that come with crickets dead, however, three times in a row?  I've given up. I believe that the way they are packaged is killing them because the last batch that came in two days didn't even have any cricket poo in it, so they died immediately.  Every one of them. I think it is the heat they put in with them...  they cooked I think.
1,Cats loved it for about 2 weeks then vomiting and litter box issues like crazy. Took them both to the vet he suggested to take them off the food and sure enough everything was fine again. I horrified to think what was in there. I ordered a few cases at a time when they were on sale so I have plenty to spare and may be taking legal action. Avoid this product!
1,Not very challenging for my Shelties.  There are much better treat balls on the market that allow adjustment of the exit holes to increase challenge.  IQ treat ball in better in this regard.
1,This product does what its suppose to do if it works, one of the collars stopped working/charging within 2 weeks of purchase! I reccommend purchasing a different product!
1,I was really hoping this would help my kitten with her seizures, but I can't get her to eat it!  The "powder" is more like sand, and just settles to the bottom of the water bowl after stirring.  This might work for a dog (since they tend to make such a mess when drinking!), but my cat rarely ever reaches the bottom of her water bowl.  I also tried mixing with applesauce, and then again with yogurt.  It made a weird paste, and she just wasn't having it. (She doesn't like canned food, but that might be a good option for some.)  If any cat owners have found a better way to deliver it, I would still like to give it a try.
1,UV o rings failed after just a few months and the pump is weak.  I guess you get what you pay for
1,After receiving the product it appears nothing like the image displayed, and my 2 Cocker Spaniels, have to be force feed these vitamins they are large round like horse pills, If they were palatable to the dogs it wouldn't matter they would chew them, but I swear when I grab the bottle and they see me opening it, they take off, run and peek around the foot of the bed. my wife and I die laughing at this reaction because it is so cute, but my Cocker Spaniels see it different.
1,Will not order these again.  They are exactly like the 'big brand' that I tried and was also dissatisfied with as they have no absorbency.  Dog pee runs over it and off the pad, pad leaks, and instead of using one I now use 3 or 4 for my 25# dog.  The best pad is Blue Ribbon, but difficult to get as it comes from only ONE supplier and must be mailed also...but using that brand, depending upon my dogs aim, he can get up to 4 uses per pad, never a leak...and least expensive...I tired this to get better delivery, but will go back to the original supplier for Blue Ribbon.
1,This product bubbles nice but will not stay in the gravel which is more than 2 inches deep I had to buy suction cups to keep it in place, I would not buy this again I would get the one that has suction cups and it was a lower price.
1,Terrible litter. If I could give this 0 stars I would. The texture is grainy and powdery, more like sand than actual clay granules. This means it scatters like crazy. The clumps are wet, sticky, and mushy; even after being given several hours to harden. The wet clumps smell terrible, not like cat urine but that awful wet clay smell, because they don't fully dry. I always use unscented litter because I am sensitive to fragrance and my cat has reoccurring URIs so I prefer to not use fragrance wherever possible, and I never have that wet clay smell with my regular litter (Dr Elseys Precious Cat). Waste of money. Avoid avoid avoid.
1,Definitely NOT extra small! This thing is huge! But my dog does enjoy playing with it even though its almost as big as he is. NOt sure if they sent the wrong size? But this is definitely not extra small, its about 9" tall!
1,Had to put another pad and or paper underneath.
1,I loved this to start with but my 10 pound dog was able to chew through the mesh. I was slightly surprised that the material allowed for that.
1,The rope body holds up well but the head is soft and can be ripped fairly easily.
1,After one use I noticed white battery powder on the clippers...It was noisy it got hot and quit working after 15 minutes...And it vibrated badly...my Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a long haired and she is a very patient laid back 2 1/2 year old and this thing even drove her nuts...I would not even try an all over clip on my almost 3 year old Standard Pembroke Welsh Corgi she's not quite as forgiving...Fortunately she only needs her rear end trimmed up a little...
1,I have no idea how K&H gets away with proclaiming this is an 'OUTDOOR' Bed!  IT IS NOT!  It is a bed that can be used INSIDE a garage, basement, covered deck, etc. And allegedly, a dog house.  But IT CANNOT get snow or rain on it.  And you CANNOT get the cord wet/snow/etc.  So how exactly does this qualify as an 'outdoor' heated pet bed?  And how can you use it in a dog house if the dog house isn't in your garage, basement, or under a covered deck attached to your house?  I can use my hair dryer inside the garage, basement, or on the deck, too!  Does that mean it qualifies as an OUTDOOR HAIR DRYER?!!  When you purchase an outdoor electrical cord, or indoor/outdoor lights, they are able to withstand TRUE outdoor elements.  This product DOES NOT meet those same standards.  After contacting the company, I was given the most lame song-and-dance I ever heard.  They claim it can be used outdoors as long as you aren't really using it outdoors!  WHAT??!  I have a covered box for feral cats here in Minnesota.  I do not have a covered deck or garage where I can plug this in.  I have to plug it into an OUTDOOR outlet on my house, as a result.  But according the K&H, the cord is NOT meant for outdoor use because 'they can't check every cord to ensure it works.'  Which makes me wonder, how in the heck do the companies that make outdoor electrical cords and outdoor lights manage?  How about you truly make this an OUTDOOR bed by upping your standards and replacing the INDOOR elements with OUTDOOR elements...such as the plug in, for starters. But until then, please REMOVE the false advertising from the front of the box.  It is very misleading.  For the record, I think the pet bed is fine, works well...as long as you use it in an area where it will never be exposed to any actual weather.  What a waste of money.
1,Kitty does not seem to like or relate to this.  He will not try it.
1,Dogs don't care about this at all. I bought them benebones in bacon flavor and they lost their minds. Save yourself the money and just buy the benebone
1,Smaller than I expected and very hard to latch the hood to the pan.
1,I put this 5 1/2" wand in my tank a little over a month ago. Now only half of the bar produces bubbles. It was great while it lasted but if I have to replace it every time I clean my 55 gal tank, it will be too expensive. I will have to look for other brands. Most of the Penn Plax Air stone I have bought lately just don't last long. They are made in China so what I bought maybe counterfeit or they just aren't making good quality anymore. It seems that the pet stores around me only carry this brand and I think one other. Not much to choose from.
1,Lasted all of about 10 minutes in the jaws of my puppy. NOT for even remotely destructive dogs.
1,Read what you feed your dog!!!!! I went from Kibbles & bits, to iams, to iams grain free, & now taste of the wild... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5QSZE/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER ...Based on quality & ingredients. Dogs can't metabolize grain so they just pass it & it actually hinders their body because of the lack of nutrition. Similar to humans only eating fast food, the body shuts down. Feeding a more expensive kibble leads to them eating less because of the quality of the food & you actually save money after the 1st bag. I have a 90+ lb chocolate lab & he could put away this 35lb bag in 3 weeks. now it takes him 2mo to get through a high quality kibble. Here's the ingredients... Ingredients: Corn, soybean meal, beef and bone meal, ground wheat, animal fat (BHA used as preservative), corn syrup, wheat middlings, water sufficient for processing, animal digest (source of chicken flavor), propylene glycol, salt, hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride, caramel color, sorbic acid (used as a preservative), sodium carbonate, minerals (ferrous sulfate, zinc oxide, manganous oxide, copper sulfate, calcium iodate, sodium selenite), titanium dioxide (color), vitamins (vitamin E supplement, vitamin A supplement, niacin supplement, d-calcium pantothenate, riboflavin supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, biotin, vitamin B12 supplement), choline chloride, calcium sulfate, yellow 5, red 40, yellow 6, BHA (used as a preservative), wheat flour, dl-methionine		Here's a link to the best dog food reviewing web site, a link to their review on this food, & a link to a better dog food (taste of the wild) & (Wellness Core)		http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/		http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/kibbles-n-bits-dog-food-dry/		http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/taste-of-the-wild-dog-food-dry/		http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/wellness-dog-food-core-dry/
1,I have a beagle who finished this in under 10 minutes. Don't waste your money even though she loved it. No odor but will keep looking for one that will last much much longer.
1,Buyer beware, 400 lb is wrong which is obvious. Then after we purched these sellers changed pack of 6 to 4. Oh so not nice! I have never had an issue like this with an Amazon seller. This so disappointing.
1,Made my cats sick. I'll stick to Fancy Feast from now on.
1,Perhaps this is just my luck, but this thing is loud, just like a jet. I tried lubricating it -- nothing
1,Timothy hay minus mango
1,dogs don't like it
1,These seem like a good idea, but between salmonella recalls and the extreme amount of supervision for safe play, I wouldn't recommend this product for teething puppies. Our Corgi puppy chewed of a sizable chunk from one of the flavored ones from this pack at about 9 weeks and would have swallowed it if we hadn't been there. Better to stick with rope chew toys and things made out of harder plastic that don't disintegrate.
1,There's no padding on the bottom at all. Basically your dog is sleeping on the hard floor on top of the wire. There's only a very thin fabric layer separating your dog from the floor and wire. My dog refuses to use it. What a waste. She'd rather use another unheated bed and shiver because the other bed is actually soft.
1,I bought this product 5 months ago. It has been installed in the ground for about three months. We just noticed that my dog is getting shocked in random areas of our yard. I had no idea. I don't know how long it was happening. I'm so incredibly disappointed in this product. I will be calling the Invisible Fence Co.	Also, the piece on the collar is very large and looks uncomfortable for the dogs to leave it on all the time, which I should be able to.	I would NOT recommend this fence.
1,I used this on my freshwater wolf fish tank and three days later my wolf fish died.
1,Too expensive.  Just buy baby wipes.
1,Very strong chemical smell so I haven't used. I tried soaking and rinsing the tubing repeatedly, but the smell is still there.
1,Cute, really small, puppy chewed it right up. Don't bother.
1,These pocket are very small. It six to fit around the table my dog has to take. He enjoys the taste. Had to purchase the pill pockets from local store. I use them as treats.
1,My 6 month old Dobie pups had the tails ripped open in five minutes within ten I was cleaning up stuffing. If you dog is a chewer don't waste your money. I bought these because of the good reviews. I'm watching now as both of them continues to shred this toy, look there goes the head. Time for more clean up than trash. If your Dog is just a mouther these would be fine but not for chewers.
1,I figured I would order a new pedipaws nail trimmer as my one from a few years ago was starting to get worn down and I had broken the yellow cover.  I waited a little while after this arrived to use it.  It goes much slower.  Plus the three boxes of replacement heads that I had for this product did not fit it.  I gave those away and through this thing out.
1,I have two different breeds of dog. They are both adult and I feed them the same food. One dog is over 60 pounds while the other is under 10 pounds. This Kibble is small enough for the small dog and large enough for the big dog. That's a minor point, but important nonetheless.		Since I started blending this food with their normal  - also grain-free - food to see if they liked it - and to avoid their stomachs and bowls not dealing well with a new food - I've seen very good results. Their stools are solid and firm. They also seem to really like the food. Ever since I stopped feeding foods with grain my dogs have never been finicky. They eat their food and they eat less of it so because they get more nutrition, which means the food lasts longer.		UPDATE: After a couple days of feeding them this food they started vomiting it up and having terrible diareaha. When I took them off the food and put them back on their regular food - all was well with them again.		I believe it must be too rich for their systems.		Won't be buying this again.		I'm still feeding the food and I will update further if anything different happens. But right now, I'm a happy camper and so are my dogs.
1,We gave it to our dog for Christmas morning (so he had something to play with as well as our 4 yr old daughter).  It worked ... till he chewed it open, got out the squeaker, and proceeded to destuff it.  Oh, but for a tougher dog toy that looks like a small animal for him...
1,We own five of these and have accumulated them over the last year.  We love the idea of this product and it certainly saves us time, and we are pleased that our animals no longer wake us up in the middle of the nite, because they are hungry, BUT after only five months of owning this 10 pound portion control feeder the food began piling up in the tray, when I took this apart I discovered the flaps on the wheel had separated from the base.  Really???  Come on surely they must have known this when during the testing phase of this product?  It's just cheap flimsy plastic that could be expected to do just what it has.  I guess I will try and come up with a way to fix this, since if I return it, it will be so not worth the hassle and shipping fees and partial refund.....What a dud... Four frowns for this product.
1,had to cut them to make them fit
1,After following the instructions the product functioned sporadically. It would work then would just quit. Unfortunately it decided to quit during a critical moment and lead to my puppy being injured. Only used for two days.
1,The price of this heater is very appealing, but the one I purchased did not last.  It performed well for about five months, and then I noticed on one cold winter night that the heater had stopped working and the water temperature in my tank was falling.  This discovery necessitated a late-night trip to a 24-hour department store to pick-up a replacement heater before the tank got too cold.  My experience may  have been an  anomaly, but I cannot recommend this product.
1,Dog got out in a second even though it was properly fit and everything.
1,Did nothing.  If anything he licked it more
1,These don't work - don't waste your money. I bought some at GNC that work much better.
1,My cat hated these and they were too big to just pop down his throat, i tried mixing them with food, grinding them up into a powder with treats. No go. So I got this in the chewable which is still vitamin smelly but I mash them up with a couple treats and he will eat it.
1,Assembly was completely unsuccessful so I can't speak for whether it would have worked for my dog. The securing screws would not thread on the one side of the pipe.  At first I thought it was because I didn't have them lined up properly due to the tension of the fabric, but even with the pipe unattached to anything else, it would not thread.  I checked all 4 screws on the working side of the pipe, so it wasn't an issue with the screws. Didn't bother getting a replacement since there's no guarantee the next one would be any better.
1,My dogs love love love these chews. However I'm buying from locate vet now @ $5 per box and a 10 minute drive to pick them up. I can buy 2 boxes for the price since shipping is 4.95 & 5.65 chews. Do the math and buy locally. Usually you can not beat Amazon for deals on anything - however this one is a huge "miss". Fix the shipping and I'll reconsider just for the convenience. If you are home bound and must buy this way I'd still say to shop around the web first for a better deal or a bulk deal.		**7/15/13** price on individual box changed from 5.59 to 10.99! I guess including the shipping cost IN the price was supposed to be better than having a shipping price which was almost the same as price of item? LOL.		These chews are fantastic and you dog will love and carry them everywhere, haven't encounter a dog yet willing to give up their 'chewy'.....but most vets stock these and even they only charge $5 bucks a box. Amazon does fantastic with shipping and rates, but this particular seller does not. Raising the price per box to include the same overpriced shipping doesn't fool anyone. You can get this product at any big box pet store or your vet. $$4.99 - $5.59		Product: 5 Stars	Price / Shipping Cost: 1 Star
1,Go with PRIME.
1,I love Plato brand for treats for my fur baby, but this one gave her diarrhea
1,what a mistake, the package came last night and the box of litter had broken open inside the shipping box. when it was on my porch there was a pile of litter under the box when I picked it up! then I happened to be at petco later on in the evening and saw it on sale for 3 bucks cheaper.	you win some , you loose some.
1,I have a 75 lb labrador retriever. A big dog, but not a huge dog. These stairs are too small for him. They are strong enough to support him, but they are way too narrow (in width and depth) for him to safely navigate. He steps on the first step and then just tries to jump the rest of the way because his head and shoulders are already so far past the tread of the second step.		Putting this together was easy. The directions have all the wrong letters indicated, but it's so simple that's not a big deal. I had it assembled in under 5 minutes. So that part is good.		But don't buy this for a dog that is more than medium-sized.		BW
1,Have bought lots of Puppia products this one didn't hold up well
1,This item is made of cheap, brittle plastic that will break on your pet's stubborn matts.
1,Has copper content and I'm not sure if it caused some of my yellow and bee shrimps to die so I threw it away after a month.
1,Gave my large do very bad gas so switched to another brand.
1,It probably works fine but we just can't use it. I believe you have to use it in conjunction with the seatbelt and our dog stays on the floor.
1,it may be healthy, but my 4 cats and kittens don't like it.
1,dogs say a no go
1,About 2 months ago I ordered 3 different brands of dry cat foods. My cat is very finicky, and will often like a food for about a week or so, then gets tired of it & won't touch it anymore.  So I usually will switch them up, and put about 3-4 of them on rotation.  So I tried this Rachael Ray Chicken & brown rice.  I poured it into his bowl, and it seemed to have a lot of crumbs, but I just chalked that up to it maybe breaking up a little during shipping.  So he ate it for several days, and then right on schedule, stopped after about a week.  So I switched it up with one of the other brands, and then the second one, and after about 3-4 weeks, I was back to the Rachael Ray.  I poured it into his bowl, and again, there were a lot of crumbs, a lot more than would seem normal, so I looked a little closer, and noticed that omg, some of them were moving!  So I poured the rest of the bag out into a trash bag, and the entire bag of food was completely infested with not just the moving bugs, but more larvae! These "crumbs" turned out to be grain weevils!  So I went & checked the other two bags I got (same shipment, but two different brands). They were both fine. I had a couple bags of treats on the same shelf, and they were fine as well, and still are. (I now check them all  weekly, just to make sure nothing is moving!)	When I looked closer at the Rachael Ray bag as I was throwing it out, I noticed there were a few on the outside bottom of the bag as well - so I checked where that bag had been sitting, and sure enough, there were about 10 little bugs crawling around!  I wiped them up, and then read up on them, and it said the safest way to get rid of them is with vinegar.  It also said that once you get infested, they get everywhere & are very hard to get rid of!  So I cleaned & scrubbed that entire area plus everything around it with vinegar, just to be sure they were gone & not coming back!	I was a little worried that my kitty might get sick from them, but it said that there is no problem eating them, they're not harmful (just protein!).  But whatever, I don't like bugs in my house, and I'm actually pretty upset that they were brought in by this bag of food!	So just beware, I'm sure my bag can't be the only one with these little crawlies!  It said that you can get something, and it seems fine at first, but is actually full of larvae - and after a few weeks the larvae hatch, and you start seeing the bugs crawling around.	UGH!!  I will never, ever, ever allow this brand into my house again, in any form!
1,We were psyched to get this litter box, but it has largely failed to live up to the promise. The fact is that, for two cats, it is so heavily preferred over the other, "manual" litter box, that it gets overwhelmed with urine and feces. I have to change out the litter tray three times a month. The instructions state that litter should last 10-15 days for two cats, but I rarely make it to 10 days. And it smells awful. The urine saturates the litter. Great that the poop is hidden, but the room has this constant and lingering full toilet bowl smell.		That said, we are moving into a house soon, so it will be easier to place at a distance from our noses. Therefore, it is totally impractical for an apartment or any place with limited space. We will also look into a reusable tray and an alternative "crystal" litter, because I'm sure we can certainly do no worse than theirs.		This is an incredibly expensive alternative to litter you scoop yourself. At $15 per litter tray, I am spending $45 a MONTH in cat litter. Having owned this since January, we've spent roughly $360 on litter alone. Not feasible! I'll happily spend 1/3 of that and scoop it myself. You should too.
1,Instructions say that it can be washed on gentle with cold water. My 10 week old Yorkie had an accident on it. I threw it in my front loader washer with mild soap on gentle with cold water and when it came out all of the filling on the raised borders had bunched up on one side of the bed and the other side went flat. It also got extremely matted which made it look old and dingy. It's a nice looking bed but only until you wash it for the first time.
1,These are a different shape and size than the original filters. So they don't fit as well and aren't as sticky either. They fall off the container all the time. People are always trying to fix what's not broken.
1,I have had sweet potato fries in the past and my dog loved them.  She won't eat these though.
1,I purchased the Feliway Comfort Zone plug-in, because my 6 month old kitten has not stopped biting since we adopted her 2 months ago.  She is biting my husband, my dog and myself. It has been so bad that my husband had to go to emergency from an infection he received from one of her "pit bull-like" bites.  This was recommended by someone at the SPCA and, having tried everything else, we decided to give it a try.  It was very disappointing.  After a week of having it plugged in, there was no change in our kitten's behavior and the unit leaked oil all around the electrical outlet!  Fearing that this may cause a fire, we discarded it immediately.  That was almost $40 thrown away and we still have a mean little kitty in the house.
1,Very very cheaply made. The unit does not come built into the collar.  Collar cannot have a leash attached to it or it will open up and dog can get free.  I received a small discount for my feedback.
1,Was excited to receive. Felt soft. Strap was not that great, and my dog popped it in less than 24hrs.
1,too small for my pup-very tight on his neck
1,came with lots of tiny ants inside the bag.
1,I bought this to take on a SW fight after reading they are lenient. My cat is about a foot high and nearly 20" long (laying) and around 10 lbs. I got him in it and he could not move! His head to tail was touching the front/back of the carrier, his head had to be turned, he could not stand up, and was quite freaked out! He tried to immediately tear at the mesh and I got him out before damage could be done. How any cat can be comfortable in this carrier stuffed under a seat is beyond me. The carrier was bulging! He is a great traveler and fine with hard carriers, which are larger, but this is far too small and inhumane to put a cat in, then under a seat for a flight! Measure your cat!
1,My cats (I have 5) love catnip. I mean they REALLY Really Love the stuff. At first they liked the compressed ball but the interaction only lasted a short while. They rolled on it, licked it and batted it around. But the novelty wore off after about 1/2 hour. Now they walk by it and are completely uninterested. I don't know if it is too much of a good thing or the catnip is poor quality or only fresh on the outside of the ball or what. But they have no interest in the ball anymore, but are still reacting to loose catnip -so I don't think that they lost that drive.	So-good idea for a product but my catnippers are unimpressed.
1,did not do much, would cost a furtune to use for every day, i had yard sprayed for fleas and ticks, works great, yes i cheat i am a pest control guy..lol
1,I gave this product two stars because my dogs didn't mind the taste and it didn't make them sick.	After several expensive bottles of this for my Border Collie and Aussi,  I didn't notice any difference. When I took the dogs to the vet she said feeding twice a day, instead of using the 'bottomless bowl' routine, and brushing their teeth would be the best dental care. She also suggested ribbed chew toys and very few treats, especially the soft sticky kind.	This product didn't make my dogs sick even though one has a sensitive stomach. Guess you could use it to make you feel better about not brushing, but she said it doesn't really do anything.
1,Chunks of lamb way too huge for elderly pug who needs canned food
1,Not perfect  Quality but my cat loves it. He top came off after my cat played with it but the company was nice enough to reimburse me for the product.
1,I got the heater a few days ago, I was waiting till I changed the water for my betta before using it. So before I changed the water I soaked it in hot water and plugged it in. After about 15 minutes I came in to check on it, it was hot but then again it could have been the water but I noticed what a few other reviews mention, a kind of wispy oily looking film/sheen on the top of the water. I quickly drained the water and refilled it, didn't see the oily stuff again, so I thought it was okay. So when I put it into my fish bowl today, it isn't even a gallon, it doesn't raise the temperature from 20C (room temperature), so I thought I'd give it a few hours, about 4 hours later no raise in temperature but it is slightly warm, it gets a LOT warmer when you take it out of the water. So I gave up and took it out of the bowl and I notice the oily sheen on top again, it's less than it was when I first saw it but I'm worried now, hopefully my betta will be fine.		So looking at the reviews here it's really a hit or miss, I guess I got a bad one.	Going to return and see if the next one is better.		UPDATE:	Got the new on in the mail, so far I tried it in the sink...the water temperature doesn't increase but it feels warmer than the older one, so I'll see how it goes. Also this one also created an oily layer, is this because I soaked it in water that's about 80 degrees?		Conclusion:	I'm going to return this second one too. So after reading around about heaters it might be because I stay in a living room with really old windows so there is always a breeze so maybe that's why it's not working....so I guess I'll try the Zoo Med BettaTherm heater since people complain it runs hot...so maybe it'll be perfect for me.
1,The good news is my cat liked it. The bad news is it lasted about an hour. The biggest problem is my cat was so enthralled with this toy, he quickly chewed through the cheap paracord used as the string which gives it an alluring bouncing movement. The cat leaps, grabs the toy, and quickly figures out that he must pull it down with one paw while making short work of the string. I retied it several times but I give up and won't buy again but I will make one.
1,I used this on my beagle, who has all the traditional beagle smells, and I swear it actually made his odor worse. I bought this because he's terrified of water and baths, but I had to bathe him to get this stuff off. Not only did it stink, it made his hair oily and greasy. I would NOT recommend this product.
1,My dog did not like this. Be careful buying this food on amazon. The exp dates are very sketchy
1,Already broke
1,Update: the material is now even thinner than ever. It's tearing just from putting litter IN the liner. Tossing out everything and finding another brand.		Original: Been ordering these for years. For the last maybe year or so, the liner went to a thinner feel and recently appears it's back to a thicker material, which is sort of nice. These don't last more than maybe 5 days before your cat's nails will start to tear through the plastic, so I just bag up the whole thing and put in fresh litter every few days. That's how it's always been with these liners and doesn't bother me at all.		The newish thicker liner is tearing a bit just pulling them out of the box where they heat seal it with the drawstring. That's the only downside of the current production quality. For some reason my cat has also managed to puncture it at the bottom despite being thicker, but I think that might have just been a fluke and I didn't have enough litter in there to begin with.
1,The ease of use was what attracted me to this litter box for the furball.... Just roll, pull out the tray and dispose.	However the filter does not stop the smaller pieces, so you end up having to scoop via the old fashion way	Recently, had to replace the box, due to the clips not staying close. Have since gone back to the traditional litter box.
1,Cat's diarrhea came back with the first (and last) packet. Will stick with Fortiflora.
1,This didn't have any effect other than smelling nice to humans. My cat actually hated the scent and it stressed her out to wear it all day. I saw a flea in her fur right next to where the collar lay against her neck so I removed the collar. It was a total waste of money. In addition, the clasp isn't the breakaway type, so a cat could be strangled by the collar or, as some have reported, get a foot caught. Best to avoid this useless product.
1,None of the pre-drilled holes matched, neither did the roof fit.	Oh, yes... the 2 stars go to the tree.
1,Not very bright, even in a blacked-out room.
1,These were just OK the squeakers don't last with my Scottie and the covers came off within a week of receiving them..
1,My dog destroyed it in ten minutes. I've had more luck with the Kong Extreme products.
1,Did not work at all.
1,The product rubbed on my dogs face, taking off some hair.  He just pulled and pulled.  May not have been the right product for my dog.
1,I have been raising fish for 40 years. I used this product in 2 of my tanks. It killed 100% of fish in 1 tank in less than 24 hours. It killed 20% of the fish in my second tank. The problem: It reduces oxygen in the tank. All the fish came to the top. I recommend cleaning your tank like I have been doing for 40 years like I have. All in all, Special Blend cost me OVER $500.00 in dead African Cichlids.
1,Measured my dog and ordered accordingly, but it was still too small. It also had a bad odor that lingered even after washing.  It is cute, and seems durable though
1,The dog ate in less than 10 min.  Had to put dog cone of shame back on....sorry pooch.
1,water gets trapped inside frame
1,my horse was lame and the Duralactin did not seem to help him as much as I was hoping however we tried STP and it did the job in 8 days I saw a large difference where in 30 days with the duralactin saw none.
1,I used to feed this to my 'keets for years without putting much thought into it.  Recently, I had garnered an interest in reviewing my care to make sure I was taking the best care of my birds that I could.  Lo and behold, I find out that this is practically parrot junk food!		From further research, pellets tend to be either very good or very bad with very little room in between.  There are two major issues that I have with this food:		1) Artificial coloring and flavoring.  We don't yet fully know the impact that these things have on bird health, and they should remain out of the food.  Coloring and flavoring should be inherent to the food.		2) Refined sugar.  You know, the white kind you find at the grocery store.		ZuPreem justifies this as being an analogue to real fruit, but it's not.  Sucrose (regular sugar) and fructose (fruit sugar) aren't the same thing.  ZuPreem unapologetically adds sucrose to this blend as its fifth ingredient, and then the real fruit starts coming in at the seventh, eighth, ninth ingredient.  So in other words, there's more table sugar than real fruit.		Do yourself a favor and stay away from this stuff.  It's not as good for the birds as ZuPreem likes to make it out to be.
1,Beware - These are literally smaller than a double A battery... total choking hazard for any dog over 5 lbs.
1,Was missing stuff. Made pretty horribly.
1,Shreds. Rough material.
1,Bought size 5, they aren't size 5. Now they aren't even sold by them any longer.
1,Seriously.. my year old lab chewed and destroyed this in 30 seconds.
1,Reasonable product but the X-Small were HUGE on my 7.5 lb chi-weenie.
1,Never heated my water :( too late to return
1,Caused severe persistent  diarrhea in my dog & he needed SC fluids- too much protein and too rich. Definitely not worth the expense for me
1,Does not work. We have given these to our lab since we got it and nothing. Lawn still yellowing bad. Not worth it.
1,My kitties didn't care for the chicken! Sorry
1,my dog is not interested. :(
1,The first problem with this leash is that its a very stiff construction. If your dog is a puller, it will hurt your hand. I often wore one glove while using this leash to protect my hand. The biggest problem is that it totally quit working after one month. I do not recommend this leash.
1,Spuld have paid more attention to reviews.  Won't contain my dog and I'm stuck with it,  Didn't save the shipping box or would send it back.
1,Revised this from a 5 star down to a 1 star. This worked wonderfully for about 3 months... then started to leak like a sieve.  We tried tightening it, getting it to seal every which way we could.  Nothing would get it to stop leaking and had to end up throwing it away as it was running our floor.  Shame.. I really loved this up until then.
1,It lasted 5 minutes.
1,this item did not fit my dog much much too small.probaly have to buy a much larger one to fit her.
1,Probably a good supplement but my small dog would not touch it - it smells very bad I think due to the seaweed. So I made homemade dog biscuits with it, a 50/50 mix with flour and this product, along with other ingredients. The smell was still very strong but my dog eventually and reluctantly would eat the treats. I think for big dogs who eat anything/everything this is probably more appropriate than for smaller dogs. Bear in mind our little shih-poo has a ravenous appetite but just wasn't a fan.
1,I opened this and had my mini dachshund try it out. The padded sides take up so much space that she was cramped! I feel like this is something for x-small dogs. I returned it, my little Goose needs something she can relax and feel comfortable in on trips.
1,This was a suck for me I put it on and it only work one night in the morning it didn't turn on no more so I got stuck with no bulb really sad because it's a little  spensive for it only to work few hours: (
1,Not worth it at all
1,Convenient and my cats liked it but it started to leak after about a month.  I could never locate the leak to seal it.  Had to throw it away.		Now I use a large pyrex bowl which I think is healthier than the plastic.
1,This item works fine until it gets crudded up with dried on poop and litter. It's a nightmare to clean, and my box went dead after 6 months. I wrote to the company TWICE and got no response at all! I would advise against buying this product. It takes less time to rake out a litter box 1-2 times a day, than to clean the mess that this box creates! And yes, I did use the recommended litter -- it made no difference!!
1,2 out of 3 ain't bad, right?  Water, more importantly dog pee goes right through. Need I say more?
1,Great bed at a reasonable price for a "normal" dog, but if your dog is a chews things, forget it.  Bed lasted about twenty minutes before our dog completely removed the padding.
1,I wish I had seen more of these reviews before buying the elite after my last one died.  I have used these machines for almost 10 years... they lasted for a good 3-5 years each before they just stopped working.  the older models were quite sturdy although haed to be careful with amount of litter and the newer tines are easier to clean.  however this one is quite flimsy and have to take apart to pull the recepticle in and out. the recepticles really don't fit well especially the flimsy replacements.  may be looking at alternatives soon as bit of a hassle to use...
1,I have 2 dogs one with a Tagg and and one with a whistle.  The Tagg worked great when it was run by Tagg.  Tagg support was excellent. Whistle is poorly functioning tracker, the website is like being stuck in a computer programming loop and support is non existent. Finding how to contact Whistle support on the Whistle website is like finding a needle in a hay stack.  Having figured out how to email support at Whistle was not a solution to my problem.  My emails are either unanswered or the reply promises a phone call which never happens.  Whistle cannot track the dog with Whistle tracker.  Whistle can track the Tagg dog 80% of the time.  I want my money back.  Support does not answer my emails.  I have even sent an email titled "Is anyone there???"
1,Does not work, you squeeze this and as soon as you stop squeezing the water goes back down into the bottle
1,I thought I would try this with my cat.. The ratings were quite high overall, but so far it has been a flop! I have gone through the exact process that Tidy Cat provides in a step by step procedure and my cat refuses to use the Breeze box. I have tried everything and feel that it is just a big gimmick and not worth the price.		First of all, I want to say that the manufacturer Tidy Cat might not provide a refund at this point in time since I had put in a request. I definitely  did all of the procedures that were outlined in the instructions, but it failed to convince my cat to stumble into the Tidy box and scrounge around in the box to do his business. He refused to move out of his clumping clay routine.		When I called and talked to a rep at Tidy Cat I was put on hold for about 15 minutes. I finally spoke to the person who took down all of my information and one question that seemed curious to me was the expiration date that should be on the shipping box. I told her that there was no such information to be found. She seemed satisfied when I told her the UPC number and said someone would call me. I said I would hope that the person who called would not ask me to give it more of a opportunity to try it for my cat and I would expect a refund and she didn't respond. To put it in perspective, I am still waiting for the call and the refund after several days! Both litter boxes are sitting next to one another and the Breeze box is totally virgin without any cat urine or poop.
1,They call this small, but the one I got was huge.  Have to send it back because it isn't appropriately sized for my bird cage.
1,My puppy was chewing on absolutely everything he could get his hands on.  While other toys from this brand are great, this one was just okay.  He didn't seem all that into playing with it after a couple of days.  I suspect it was because he couldn't get a good grip on it because it moves and collapses every time he tries to get a hold of it between his paws or chomp on it.  If the pieces could be linked together in such a way to make them lay flat, it might work better.
1,Absurd. 2' x 4' is a standard size sod strip sold by every home improvement store in the country. Price: under $5.00. Buy the dog crate replacement tray on Amazon for under $30. Do it yourself and save.	I understand not everyone has the time and ability to purchase sod every 2 weeks or so.
1,The pellets are painfully hard. Don't subject your cats to this. But the pellets don't travel around the house. My cats would not dig to cover their feces in this type of substrate so feces odor control was non existent. If you work or are away at school, then odor control will be a big issue with this kind of litter system. Washing the pellets to reuse is incredibly time consuming and disgusting work. The urine soaked pads must be replaced every other day if you have two cats and want to control urine odor. Pellets and pads are expensive and must be purchased regularly. The tidy cats breeze does not work well with pine pellets which is whi I originally bought this. The wet dissolved pellets block the openings at the bottom and the sawdust that does fall through accumulates soo quickly, cleaning out the bottom tray is a daily/sometimes even twice a day task. The Breeze was all hype and not much better than using other litters and a regular litter box. I'd LOOOVE to know who the reviewers are that are writing these reviews....		After trying dozen of litter systems, what did work for me and my two cats? Wood pellets, with a regular litter box and litter box liner. This system has been the most odor free, easy, clean, least time consuming, and cat approved method of all the million things I tried. The wood pellets control odor great, buy it as horse bedding and you can buy a 30 pound bag for maybe 7 dollars. Exact same stuff as Feline Pine but nowhere near their exorbitant price. I think my cats associate the wood smell with nature and are actually attracted to using this kind of litter. Empty out the box twice a week by carrying litter liner plus litter to trash can, reline box and add litter, scoop out solids daily, and shake the box daily to sink sawdust to the bottom and voila! Takes a few minutes a day, litter box issues and UTI's are nonexistent for us.
1,This pump is a small power house. it has two exhaust ports and opened both. it was still to powerful for my 60 gal tank. I ended up closing one and using the supplied flex tubing to attach the pump to a water diffuser bar. this took care of the problem and circulates the surface water like a dickens. This pump will work on my 150 gl and end some. I got three more to crank up my tank and may not need all three for the 150 gl, so I may use it on my breeder with a bio sponge in the corner. Also with a diffuser bar...
1,This collar works great; however, the plastic piece that holds the nose loop in place has broken in less than less than 5 months.
1,I have no choice but to get these because my aquarium is so nasty and green from trying to do the refillable carbon cartridge. I hate to get these because the carbon is everywhere in the box when I receive them which leads me to believe it is the reason my aquarium STINKS. BUT, that being said, at least my aquarium isn't GREEN while using these cartridges.
1,Can be very dangerous if you have a big, healthy dog.		My dog swings it like a bat, so I took it away from her.  She could hurt someome, herself or something in the house.
1,I was looking for a good quality hay for my little bunny. I don't know, what happened, but the quality of timothy hay is absolutely unacceptable for the last few years. I tried so many brands, but result was always the same - 50% of  a mixture  of brown rotten leaves and harsh straws.	Read about this particular hay - third cut, the highest quality etc., and looked at the pic, showing how this hay is looking, I decided to give it a try. It is expensive, almost 14 bucks for 1Lbs. But I wanted a good grass for my bunny :)		Don't waste your money, folks. Same all same... My bunny doesn't want even to look at it. You can buy the same quality hay in any pet store for a half price.	Big dissapoinment!		P.S. Here is a photo of the hay I got. Nothing even close to the pic, shown online.
1,Poorly made, It ripped the first time I put it on my dog
1,This toy did not squeak as advertised.  Unfortunately, I bought it early, and put it away for my cat's stocking, and I just noticed the problem, so I can't return it.  Beware of poor quality!
1,My pup likes to chew on this and it's larger than a typical Nylabone, but you can't insert any kind of treats except the Kong branded ones.
1,I really don't know how people will give them such high rating. This is the second nylabone product i have to return. All three of the bones has "ZERO" scent. None what so ever. My 9 weeks old puppy is notorious to chew anything. I mean anything. I have given her non flavored cowhide, greenie, puppy ediable bones and she loved every single one of them. I put all 3 of them on the floor to let her choose one favorite. She sniffed all of them and just walked away. I tried 3 other times and she time she just backed away. They smell like absolute nothing to me. I figured maybe my puppy can smell a vague scent somehow. Appreantly it isn't anything to her at all. waste of money
1,Like some other commenters, I wish I had read reviews here first. This absolutely does not work. In fact, my dogs want to lick where I sprayed (which probably isn't good for them). And they refuse to go where I spray it. It's basically useless. You might as well try using water.
1,Don't buy here! They show a picture of size x-large but no other info on sizing. Assumed it must be an x-large by the picture and no other info. Got a medium day before surgery. Really put my in a bad spot. Be carful!
1,Why is this product no longer eligible for Prime?	They increased the price and now charge for shipping. It is outrageous!!!		This is an update on my review from yesterday.	The product is great and it i the only kind my dogs will eat. On that note. I looked all over the internet to find the adult and senior formula and every single one if out of stock.	I think there might be a recall or something...
1,I have both my small dogs on these for 6 weeks now.  No noticeable difference at all in the skin or coat. I was hoping for more shiny coat, so I will look for another product. This is too expensive not to see a difference. My dogs do love the taste.  UPDATE:  I just read it takes about 6 weeks to notice a difference so i will wait a few more weeks and update my review.
1,My chinch won't go in it. She won't even stay in it when we help her in!
1,Didn't make the cat feel good.
1,One bulb was crushed in package. Packaging could have been much better then it was. What else can you say no idea if it worked or not
1,Had to purchase a large harness to fit a 24 pound dog -- go figure -- but I knew that before the purchase. What I didn't know was that the stitching would fail after two months and the harness would start to fall apart. Three stars means "it's OK" but something that falls apart after two months is definitely not OK, so two stars, which mean's "I don't like it." I liked it before it started to fall apart... but that was then, and this is now.
1,I am returning this toy as soon as possible. The odor is unbearable and it's not safe for my puppy or any pets
1,I have a pair of these same clippers from 18 years ago (yes!). It is a different brand, but obviously my brand has lasted decades. This pair is not sharp or nearly as weighty as my same pair. It just doesn't cut a dog's nail. We don't have large dogs - 18lb, 15lb, 20lb. I only ordered these because my pair is very dull and very old. I am going to look for other pet nail clippers.
1,Latch broke after 2 days
1,Way too floppy
1,Item broke after a couple weeks of use.
1,I have a 100lb Pit mix and he destroyed the ball in 2 minutes.. Won't bother giving him the other 2. Will save them if I get a smaller dog. Would not recommend it for a large dog it could end up in their belly or choke them. I gave it 2 stars because it would be best for a small dog to throw back and forth, but take it away if he's loves chewing his toys.
1,Do not like heavy, makes no sound, and our Dog loves toys, not this one!  If you hit some with it, it is hard.  Do not bother buying.
1,Don't bother.  These are too expensive. They don't filter out large particles. The carbon in them does not keep the water clear. Buy the bulk filter, cut to size, and put a bag of Chemi-pure Blue in the filter housing.
1,Don't waste your money.  Little boy pups will shoot over the edges.  Not easy to clean.  Prefer just putting the pad on the floor.
1,I'm sure it would be a great product, if i could get my cats to eat it.  Maybe it's because the pieces are too large?
1,I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)
1,Plastic parts cheaply made. Hose fittings continually disconnects from faucet. Had to glue some parts to make it stay together.		Would not buy again, about as much work as a manual water change, ended up using manual syphoner, much easier,less work.
1,Functional
1,Has harmful chemicals for your DOG
1,My dogs (55lb and 25lb) loved this toy which is why it didn't just get one star. Within two days of tugging at it, the ends have come out (they don't even seem to have been sewn in, they were just tucked into it) and the rope has started to uncoil. If the ends had been sewn on, it might have lasted longer. Very cheaply made and I wouldn't recommend it.
1,i had to pay $2,000 to have string removed from my cat's stomach.  this product is a TERRIBLE concept. many cats are attracted to things like hair ties and string anyway, and encouraging them to consume them by making them associate string with tasty food is going to cause deaths. who came up with this garbage?!!!!
1,Cats loved it however found fish bones in food after my cat began choking while eating this. Scared me to death. I searched other containers from two different cases and sure enough more bones. I rather give them Fancy feast might not be as healthy but I have never once found a bone in their products. If you do use this brand then always check before feeding it to them! i do use the dry food and haven't found any issues and my cats love that too. But I cant and won't put them at risk by purchasing this wet food product ever again!
1,The collar would work intermittingly as I would have to pull the battery, and put it back in to get it to start working quite often. Within the first few days I had to pull the battery at least 5 times a day. Perhaps I got a lemon, but I sent it back for Bark Solution brand, and it has worked perfectly since day 1. My pit mix almost instantly stopped barking. Bark Solution brand was a few dollars more, but works perfectly.
1,I saw this was not lying flat in the bottom of the crate so I went to fix it and found that the gel was all balled up. I tried everything to smooth out the gel but there was no solution. I only had it a few days! Terrible product, but many thanks to Amazon for the easy return. Now I have ordered Pet Dog Self Cooling Mat Pad for Kennels, Crates and Beds- Arf Pets for double the price. I hope it is a better product. We don't have AC and my dog needs something so he doesn't have to spend his summer laying in the bathtub.
1,These are horrible. I guess they absorb ok but they look like torn up cotton stuffed into some plastic. Go with a better product.
1,Deceptive. Measurements are not as stated.
1,Cat will not let me near him with this.
1,Nice but small.
1,Cat won't eat anything its in; so its a waste of money for me.
1,Used this food once in a pinch. Won't use it again. My dog didn't like it. Now that I know how to figure out how much sugar is in a dog food, I will never feed it again! Dog food companies don't have to tell you how much sugar/carbs are in a bag of food. This food would be like humans eating Lucky Charms for every meal. The formula to figure out the sugar/carb content is add the percentages for these items given on every bag of dog food: 1) Protein 2) Fat 3) Fiber 4) Moisture. Once you have that number add 6. According to the label on this bag of Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula the total percentages for these items is 51%. Subtract the 51% from 100% and the answer of 49% is how much sugar/carbs is in this bag of food. Dogs should only have 4% carbs and no sugar. By the way, Blue Buffalo brand was purchased on 2/23/2018 by General Mills for $8 BILLION dollars. Since their cereal and yogurt sales are down they are looking for something more profitable. The pet industry is huge! What do you think a cereal company knows about making dog food. My guess would be about zero. Buffalo Blue has used great marking ideas to sucker people into buying a low quality food and now it has paid off big for them.
1,I bought three jars of this to give my 5 dogs over a two week + period as two of them are poop eaters. I liked the safe ingredients and really hoped it might work despite a lot of reviews saying it doesn't. Never know until you try. It didn't do anything to curb the behavior for them.
1,We did not like this because our Lab did not like it. We wanted to keep the water from spilling out on the wood and tile, but he refused to use this. We sent this back and our dog is happy drinking and eating from his bowls on the floor (on a place mat).
1,I bought this and can't use it.. my puppies won't sit still long enough
1,Made my cat sick to his stomach.
1,Egg crate bottom, very lightweight & flimsy.  That should be the description.  This is sure to compress what little fluff it has within a month of our 75lb English Bulldog.  I would pay about $30 for this max.  We went with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NEW-PetFusion-Ultimate-Dog-Bed-Lounge-Large-Slate-Gray-36-x-28-x-9-5-34-Premium-Edition-w-Solid-4-34-Memory-Foam/dp/B00TQ47CPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">[NEW] PetFusion Ultimate Dog Bed & Lounge.

Our dog stepped two feet in this & barked violently at us.  We had to laugh, I swear he was yelling at us that this wasn't good enough.  He didn't react the same with the PetFusion. In fact, he's snoozing away in it next to me now.  Pay the extra money & get your dog a bed that's worth it or find a bed for $30-$50 that's worth at least that much.
1,If theres catnip inside, it must be stale. They couldn't be less intereted.
1,Came in 5 peices
1,Nice idea, poorly executed. To get water from it, it must be totally full and in the car I have to prop it up on something to give dogs access to water. I far prefer a water hole type product. Oh, it also slides around the car while I'm driving. It would make sense to have some kind of non-skid bottom to keep it in place
1,My Jack Russell Terrier and Australian Shepherd had this in chunks within 15 minutes. A waste of money for me.
1,I have 2 of these and they do somewhat work, but compared to their competition (some of which is cheaper than them!) they're terrible.		There's no way of knowing if these things actually work.  If the battery is low, there's no way to know, and as others said, its very prone to the food rotting.		There are tons of other feeders with programmable LCD displays that sell for $20 or less, so there's absolutely no reason to get this one.
1,My dog ignored these. Too bad.
1,I give this two stars because our dog loved this... otherwise it would have been one. She isn't a big chewer, but this was dismantled in less than 24 hours. She played with the pieces for a month though... lol.
1,Amazing if you like HOLES IN YOUR LITTER BAGS. I liked these at first and then bought them in bulk, and then 3 or 4 out of each box had no bottom. These are too expensive to be pieces of crud (which you will, in fact, get all over you, if you dare to use them). See attached photo for reference. I hate that it's too late to return these to Amazon for a refund.		I am sending bottomless litter bag samples back to the manufacturer that they can frame, because I'm sure they're laughing all the way to the bank.
1,This thing is a waste of time and money. The dog stops caring after a while because it goes off regardless of what she does. This tactic only works if it is very precise, and this device is anything but
1,We have a 100+ pound german shepherd that shows fear aggresion when it thunderstorms.  We bought this and placed it near the main area that he hangs out.  I'm not sure if we need two or what but our dog still shows fear aggression.  He has stopped biting when it thunders but he still barks, growls, pants, and shakes, until the storm is over.  We found it easier to just take him down to the basement now when it storms.
1,EDIT: Be careful with plastic water fountains. My cat almost died from a bacteria infection. It took weekly visits to the vet, $100's of dollars in vet bills and 2 months before we realized what the issue was.		I am OCD clean, so I cleaned this regularly, and changed the filter as recommended. Perhaps my cat was just super sensitive, but I wouldn't take the chance again.
1,First time I gave it to my dog it ripped in the first 30 min. We've had Starmark toys before that were great but this one didn't last which is disappointing because he loves them so much,
1,1/10 for product- I ordered this the first time and there were 2 missing pieces from the box. I contacted the seller (which was nice and told me to send the other one back and they would send me a new box) and they sent me a replacement. I opened the replacement product and there was 1 missing piece from there, too. I'm happy I decided to wait to send the first box back. I decided instead of contacting the seller for a third time, I would just build the cat toy from the combined 2 boxes of pieces.		9/10 for cat enjoyment- It took a while for my cat to get the hang of the concept, but now she loves it and it's so entertaining to watch how her little mind works.
1,After a cycle of six times it stops and won't keep going around - you must restart it.  So much for planning on just keeping it refilled every now and then and it keep on truckin', but it did dispense as programmed.  Also, after opening the lid three times, the clip on one side that secures the lid decided to fall off.  Returned it as defective and didn't want to bother with another based on the other reviews of malfunctions.
1,this is the most annoying toy you will ever buy.  it chirps non stop, even from vibration of your foot.  there is no way to turn the chirp off.  I threw this ball over the fence but my German shepherd keeps bringing it back.  it's the spawn of satan that won't go away.  they should invest in these batteries for cellphones.
1,My cat had no interest in this toy.  Was a waste of money and even tried giving it to other cats with no success.
1,Our dogs have always loved their water fountain. We're not sure if it's these, the filters or the brand new pump we bought with it, but we're having to change the filter every few days and we do not use tap water. We use high quality filtered water in the mountains. We're looking into buying a different brand that may be more reliable.
1,Does not work on Mercedes GLK without some serious installation creativity.  The back seats and roof need to be very flat for this to install easily
1,Doesn't work as described and directions don't help much.
1,This did not last 5 minutes.  Its advertising is not what you get
1,sooooper flimsy. not expensive enough to worry about, but yuck.
1,My dog loves it, but a few days in it was somewhat shredded. It started tearing up my pup's gums.
1,My birds don't play with it.
